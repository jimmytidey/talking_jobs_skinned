      <p begin="00:00:00.236">I wanted to be a policeperson believe it or not!  That’s what I wanted to do when I was at school, I always wanted to join the</p>
      <p begin="00:00:06.646">Metropolitan Police but when I left school it became quite clear the only reason I wanted to do that was because I wanted to follow my 2 friends</p>
      <p begin="00:00:15.112">who actually joined the Met so I think I learned very quickly after school because sometimes when you’re in school you dream about things</p>
      <p begin="00:00:21.812">but sometimes it’s not quite the right vocation to go into because sometimes you do follow your friends and listen to what they want to do</p>
      <p begin="00:00:31.802">but that’s what I thought I wanted to do and I did actually go for an interview for it and realised at the interview that it wasn’t for me;</p>
      <p begin="00:00:39.081">saying that, though, I didn’t have the education to go in there anyway but saying that I did get to the interview stage which I was quite pleased about.</p>
