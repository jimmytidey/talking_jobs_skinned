      <p begin="00:00:00.389">When I first went to Secondary School I went to a Grammar School and I got in a few bit of trouble for the first year,</p>
      <p begin="00:00:07.886">a lot of fights and stuff I was getting in so my parents moved me after the first year.  School is one of those things that if I could</p>
      <p begin="00:00:18.339">do it again I don’t know maybe I’m the only one that thinks like this but you know sometimes you think imagine you could relive time</p>
      <p begin="00:00:26.741">or do school again or imagine you could look like you’re 14 and do school all over again because I’d do it totally differently</p>
      <p begin="00:00:32.818">because my experiences at school weren’t all that great, I was always sort of like it’s a sort of cliché but you know everyone always</p>
      <p begin="00:00:40.946">says they were bullied at school and stuff like that... Yeah I was, school for us it was sort of rough but it was good at the same time</p>
      <p begin="00:00:49.338">so you know I was one of the only ones with dreadlocks at the time so I stood out so not only was I dealing with standing out amongst</p>
      <p begin="00:00:56.964">say English and Caucasians because I was black but I was also different to, you know, to black people as well because I had locks</p>
      <p begin="00:01:05.031">so that was seen as a bad thing as well whereas now if I’d go to school right now this is like the latest fashion so I’d be like the cool kid</p>
      <p begin="00:01:12.099">in school, it’s just why I want to do it all again but yeah that’s, school is hit and miss I had good moments I had bad moments</p>
      <p begin="00:01:19.513">but then every kid does.  Back in Year 8 I did drama for the first time and it was just one session I remember acting was nothing I was</p>
      <p begin="00:01:28.039">ever even thinking about or anything like that it wasn’t in my vision I’d never experienced anything to do like that before</p>
      <p begin="00:01:34.375">so we’re doing an hour class and we’re adlibbing and acting little parts out and she was like “you’re quite good at this,</p>
      <p begin="00:01:42.044">you’re quite good at acting” and I was like “oh, OK” went back to the next session, did drama again and she was like</p>
      <p begin="00:01:49.308">“no, they’re doing some drama group and some auditions at a local television centre do you want to try for that?”</p>
      <p begin="00:01:55.453">I tried and I got in first time and that’s one of the first things I tried and got in straight away and I just enjoyed it ever since</p>
      <p begin="00:02:02.146">so I would say that encouraged me to look past the norm, back then as well you don’t have a lot of role models to look up to</p>
      <p begin="00:02:11.255">I mean there’s no solicitors, no doctors living in my area so I didn’t really have that to look up to so seeing a different,</p>
      <p begin="00:02:18.372">experiencing something different, outside my normal scope at the time yeah so I enjoyed it and that encouraged me to look at different things</p>
      <p begin="00:02:29.120">rather than things I’d never thought of before</p>
