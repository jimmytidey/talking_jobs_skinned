      <p begin="00:00:00.048">I think probably when I lost my dad I think that was a massive change in my life; I was able to get the opportunity to go out</p>
      <p begin="00:00:08.717">to Jamaica on a youth exchange where Prince Charles paid for 15 of us to go out to Jamaica so when I came back from Jamaica</p>
      <p begin="00:00:16.357">I brought some photos back and I went to Bristol, St Paul’s where my dad’s from and I went into his... well I thought he lived</p>
      <p begin="00:00:25.480">in a flat but when I got there it was a bedsit and it was probably about from the side of that wall there to about here</p>
      <p begin="00:00:31.961">and I walked in there and he had a car seat as a settee, he had a picture of Haile Selassie who’s the Jamaican god</p>
      <p begin="00:00:39.207">and he had a little table, he had a little single bed, he had a black and white TV and I just knew he wasn’t living a conscious life.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:47.116">We sat there and we spoke and I was drug dealing at the time but I thought I’m not going to tell you that. As I went to leave</p>
      <p begin="00:00:55.113">he said to me “oh can you go and get me something from the kitchen cupboard” and he had this little box</p>
      <p begin="00:00:59.259">and I went to go and get it and came back and he opened it up and he gave me a bag of 2ps in a money bag, it was about</p>
      <p begin="00:01:06.514">£1.60 in there, bless him, and I was like “oh thank you dad” I didn’t want to say “what am I going to do with that? I’ve got £300-£400 in my pocket in notes&quot;</p>
      <p begin="00:01:15.166">but I thought I couldn’t tell him that so I left it at that and as I went to leave the house and he gave</p>
      <p begin="00:01:20.005">me the money bag he grabbed my hand and he said “God’s speaking to me at this moment” and I said “what do you mean?”</p>
      <p begin="00:01:26.798">he said “you’re not living a righteous life” and I said “what do you mean dad?” and he said “you know what I mean”</p>
      <p begin="00:01:31.674">he said “you know where I am” and I was like “yeah alright” and as I went to leave and he grabbed me and he said</p>
      <p begin="00:01:36.037">“do you know what? There’s one thing I want you to become, is a leader not a follower” and I was like “yeah, yeah alright dad, alright”</p>
      <p begin="00:01:41.807">in one ear and out the other and unfortunately I think it was 4 months later I had a phone call from my mum to say that</p>
      <p begin="00:01:49.785">my dad had collapsed in the bookies in Bristol and he, yeah he passed away 10 minutes after the phone call so I went to go and see him</p>
      <p begin="00:02:04.578">in the chapel of rest in Bristol and I asked my mum if I could have 10 minutes with him alone and as my mum walked out and I shut the chapel door</p>
      <p begin="00:02:15.630">it was like these speakers just came on and all I could hear was my dad saying “be a leader not a follower, be a leader not a follower”</p>
      <p begin="00:02:23.685">and I just broke down crying and that was it and I gave up everything, everything and again I’d done every drug apart from heroin</p>
      <p begin="00:02:36.170">through my time of drugs and that so I thank my dad every day for giving me this opportunity because I think if it weren’t for the loss</p>
      <p begin="00:02:44.421">of my dad I don’t think I’d be where I am now I think I’d probably be either behind bars or maybe possibly in a body bag myself...</p>
