      <p begin="00:00:11.888">and stuff; my dad was an ex Royal Marine and I would have loved him to see me join the Army, he’d turn in his grave if he knew</p>
      <p begin="00:00:18.855">I joined the Army and not the Marines but you know I’d have loved him to have seen that and he didn’t; that had a massive effect</p>
      <p begin="00:00:25.335">and I think from there on in I’ve made my own way really with what I’ve done and tried to be resilient in what I’ve done and stuff</p>
      <p begin="00:00:35.257">and want to do the best that I can...</p>
