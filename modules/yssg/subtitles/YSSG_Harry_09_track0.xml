      <p begin="00:00:00.059">School... Junior School or Primary School was OK, it was difficult; my father died when I was 9 and that left a massive hole in my life really</p>
      <p begin="00:00:14.549">and then I went to Senior School my mum got married again when I was about 11 or 12, I went to big school, Secondary School, was mucking about</p>
      <p begin="00:00:26.533">all the time really and I wish I’d applied myself a lot more and I wasn’t stupid by any stretch of the imagination and walked out of school with</p>
      <p begin="00:00:34.393">3 O-Levels, I was passionate about history and I still love history and geography and got O-Levels in those subjects and stuff</p>
      <p begin="00:00:42.185">but I didn’t try and I was lucky I had a good memory and could retain knowledge and stuff but I should have applied myself more in</p>

      <p begin="00:01:11.638">I had a bit of a talent for geography and history and stuff and he told me that I was good enough to do CSE but he was going to enter me</p>
      <p begin="00:01:20.904">for O-Level and he said if I did apply myself in those subjects that I would pass and, you know, he used to take a bit of extra care and</p>
      <p begin="00:01:28.931">check my homework twice and made sure I did it and goodness knows what and I did pass those two subjects, you know, and</p>
