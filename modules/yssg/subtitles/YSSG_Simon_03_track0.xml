      <p begin="00:00:00.028">I worked in retail and watching people basically the general public going round and I thought you know you get the gist of people acting suspiciously</p>
      <p begin="00:00:12.556">possible shoplifters and I thought yeah I could possibly...  Well I want to be a security officer yeah, yeah and it was quite not for everybody but</p>
      <p begin="00:00:22.999">in retail it can be quite mundane but I wanted something challenging so I thought yeah I’ll be a security officer.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:32.253">People have this perception that being a security officer is mundane you know they sit in the office, they put their feet up, possibly fall asleep at night</p>
      <p begin="00:00:39.364">but it’s not the case, your mind’s always working watching CCTV or walking round and every day can be different, some days are the same</p>
      <p begin="00:00:48.901">but there’s always that aspect that something might happen.</p>
