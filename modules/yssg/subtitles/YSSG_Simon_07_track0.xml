      <p begin="00:00:00.477">I can only say from my experience because I’m 33 when I was 18 going for a job employers, I’m not standard stereotypical,</p>
      <p begin="00:00:08.625">but employers looked for the perfect face, perfect body of course when I went for an interview walking through the door they probably thought</p>
      <p begin="00:00:18.623">well most of them thought we’ll be nice to him but there’s no chance...  And I don’t know what employers are looking for,</p>
      <p begin="00:00:30.370">I can’t really say these days but when I was 18 I think they were looking for perfection and as you know nobody’s going to get perfection are they?</p>
      <p begin="00:00:39.176">With the Olympics I think people’s attitudes have changed, maybe more accepting is the word but I hope so, some people’s attitudes have changed</p>
      <p begin="00:00:55.336">but there’s always people that are going to be difficult about it, I class myself, well I class people with disabilities as a minority</p>
      <p begin="00:01:03.531">some people don’t, some people do but I hope so is the word I can’t really say for sure that people’s attitudes have changed.</p>
