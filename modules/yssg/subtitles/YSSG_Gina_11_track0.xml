      <p begin="00:00:00.077">I think where I’d sort of done an apprenticeship and hadn’t gone to college there wasn’t really any surprises because you’re learning in</p>
      <p begin="00:00:09.433">the environment you’re going to be working in so the surprises you get are sort of you’re not getting taught... It’s hard to explain without</p>
      <p begin="00:00:17.650">making any sense but because you’re working in that environment the surprises that come along you just deal with as a part of it</p>
      <p begin="00:00:24.696">whereas if you’re sort of training in college they can’t tell you anything like that can they you just get taught the basics, how to type a letter or, you know,</p>
      <p begin="00:00:31.634">how to pay an invoice but when you do it in a work environment if someone comes in and starts kicking up a fuss you’re dealing with it</p>
      <p begin="00:00:39.595">there and then as you’re learning so it’s not really a surprise I guess and there’s always someone there, you know, you can turn to</p>
      <p begin="00:00:45.380">if it’s above your head, your line manager, to go to for help so no, no real surprises.</p>
