      <p begin="00:00:00.364">One of the reasons I chose to go into lettings is because I’d done a lot of different things but not something solidly so I didn’t have</p>
      <p begin="00:00:09.323">a degree or a qualification so this was a sector I could go into and be good at through hard work, I didn’t have to have any pre-qualifications</p>
      <p begin="00:00:18.910">which I think was really nice about it.  But once you’re in the industry there is a lot of kind of professional development so there’s</p>
      <p begin="00:00:26.572">an association called ARLA that’s the association that regulates letting agents and they provide a qualification, firstly a basic qualification</p>
      <p begin="00:00:36.670">which is a Level 3 entry and then they have an advanced qualification which is a Level 4 entry.  And I think timeframe you’re probably looking at</p>
      <p begin="00:00:47.089">maybe 6 months for a Level 3, part-time, and then 18 months for Level 4.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:55.030">Because I work full-time I had to literally get up at 4 in the morning and study until 6 every day even on weekends to get it all done</p>
      <p begin="00:01:03.673">so but it was worth it.  I must add that I left it, my course was an 18 month period and I left it a year before I did anything so I had to compact</p>
      <p begin="00:01:15.578">18 months worth of study into 6 months so that’s why it was those kind of hours.</p>
