      <p begin="00:00:00.493">I saw finance always as a challenge and in finance to work in the business and the finance environment has always been a challenge</p>
      <p begin="00:00:07.492">and also a passion for me like I said I’m new to the work and because in my previous role I was a finance administrator in income,</p>
      <p begin="00:00:18.432">an income officer, and that started as a work experience and then as the time went by I started learning and learning and learning</p>
      <p begin="00:00:27.929">and enjoying it more and that’s the most important because I’m young, I’m still young, and that’s what I enjoy learning and kind of working with</p>
      <p begin="00:00:38.981">great people and having great people to work with around you and I enjoy making my family proud of me, you know, of coming here</p>
      <p begin="00:00:48.581">from a difficult background and going through everything by myself and achieving everything by myself it&apos;s a big thing for me</p>
      <p begin="00:00:57.326">it’s really important because nobody thought I would have, from my circumstances, be where I am today...</p>
