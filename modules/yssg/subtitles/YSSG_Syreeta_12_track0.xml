      <p begin="00:00:00.355">There’s 4 children, I’m the middle child, single parent family...  Yeah hard times but we came through.  I think a lot of influence, obviously education</p>
      <p begin="00:00:19.508">was key; my mum had us quite young so that’s always been something that I’ve always thought about you know getting a career</p>
      <p begin="00:00:31.401">and setting myself up, laying foundations before having my own children so and also because she was a single parent and she did so much</p>
      <p begin="00:00:42.042">it was also giving us the drive to be go-getters I guess and we don’t let anything hold us back so we have got that whole fighting mentality</p>
      <p begin="00:00:51.340">My mother has always done things like that fit around children so it could be like cleaning, bar work, now she’s nursing as qualified so</p>
      <p begin="00:01:04.593">we’re proud of her for that because she’s gone back and retrained so yeah...</p>
