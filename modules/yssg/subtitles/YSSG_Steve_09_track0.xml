      <p begin="00:00:00.415">I didn’t like it, school, to be honest with you.  The reason why I didn’t like it is because back when I was at school in the ‘70s and ‘80s</p>
      <p begin="00:00:09.395">I don’t think that the education system fully understood that some people had learning difficulties and one of the things that I have got</p>
      <p begin="00:00:21.119">is dyslexia which wasn’t recognised then so when you’re at school and you couldn’t read or write people used to sort of look at you as if you</p>
      <p begin="00:00:32.847">were a thick person and they used to take the mick out of you and you were bullied to be frank with you, you know when you’re sat there</p>
      <p begin="00:00:40.829">in class and you can’t understand what’s in front of you and the kids around you can’t understand why you can’t understand it it was quite painful.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:50.535">For somebody who’s got a learning difficulty they’ve also got a strength and I found that my strength was running so if I wanted to</p>
      <p begin="00:00:56.922">get away from anything I would just get out there and just run, you know not like Forrest Gump but just run.  It’s difficult to explain that</p>
      <p begin="00:01:05.943">to be honest with you because there was no help there.</p>
