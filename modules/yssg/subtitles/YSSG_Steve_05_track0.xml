      <p begin="00:00:01.282">My job does impact on my life outside work because unfortunately it’s time constraint, you know you can suddenly say at 5 o’clock you can go home</p>
      <p begin="00:00:10.414">so I may have made arrangements to see the kids and unfortunately you’ve sometimes got to pick up the phone and say “I’m sorry I can’t make it</p>
      <p begin="00:00:18.335">because such and such a thing has happened” but it’s got better, I will say that, 13 years ago you couldn’t really plan anything but now</p>
      <p begin="00:00:27.401">we’ve got to the stage where we’ve got more staff in place and management in place to deal with things and I’m finding now</p>

      <p begin="00:01:08.356">I walk quite a lot and there’s a lot of walking around in my sort of job really because as well as being joint MD I do go out and do surveys</p>
      <p begin="00:01:18.445">quite a lot so I am on my feet walking around so it is quite an energetic type of work so you do really get exercise whilst you work I suppose in one way.</p>
