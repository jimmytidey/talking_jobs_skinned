      <p begin="00:00:00.347">I meet different people every day; I do lots of different treatments that can be from spray tanning to an eyebrow wax.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:10.473">It is getting to know your client as well, keeping record cards, you know noting if they’ve been on holiday or something</p>
      <p begin="00:00:20.479">so you can bring it up the next time they come in.  Being professional, also like when it’s your salon you need to make sure</p>
      <p begin="00:00:30.242">the health and safety checks are done, the cleanliness of the salon, the bookkeeping, the appointment making;</p>
      <p begin="00:00:40.030">there’s lots to do as a beautician.  If it was an admin day it would literally just be 9am-5pm, you know core hours</p>
      <p begin="00:00:52.129">but obviously working for yourself in your own business it can be all day every day so when the clients are there I’ll be working</p>
      <p begin="00:01:01.799">and if they’re not obviously I’ll be using my time doing something else so like I could be working 8:30am-8:30pm because I’ve got a busy day</p>
      <p begin="00:01:11.747">but then I’ll also be taking bookings whenever I’m getting people contacting me so it is 24 hours really, all the time, constant.</p>
