      <p begin="00:00:00.196">It was really hard for me to picture myself in an office environment I felt because of my background, because of my language</p>
      <p begin="00:00:09.825">my accent, you know, can be difficult but you know because of my lack of confidence in that environment but once I was in</p>
      <p begin="00:00:19.796">the first week you know I had a different perception about it you know I felt completely different to what I had thought before</p>
      <p begin="00:00:30.142">you know it was a surprise that it is different, it is a good environment to work in you know people are great, people want to teach you things</p>
      <p begin="00:00:39.450">yeah I would have thought like people would just be about everybody trying to save a position and so on you know I had that but now</p>
      <p begin="00:00:48.598">I was completely wrong you know, I was completely shocked in how much they have helped me and nurtured me through that time</p>
