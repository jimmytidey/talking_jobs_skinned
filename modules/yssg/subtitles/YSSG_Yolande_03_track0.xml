      <p begin="00:00:09.053">and it not working out and then from a personal perspective buying a house, renting it out, then it started intriguing me and I got to a point in my life</p>
      <p begin="00:00:19.851">where I needed to have a full-time career and this is what I got into because I knew a lot about it at that point.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:26.722">I love the variety, I love the people, you know I think it’s all about connecting with humans whatever we do and whatever job we’re in so it’s nice to build a</p>
      <p begin="00:00:38.815">relationship, as a letting agent you don’t just, you know, rent a house to somebody and you never see them again it’s about, you know,</p>
