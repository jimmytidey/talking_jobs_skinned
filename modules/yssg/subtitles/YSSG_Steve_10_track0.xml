      <p begin="00:00:00.134">I’ve gone through quite a lot of training to get where I am today, really because I really enjoy the vocation I’m in and because I enjoyed it</p>
      <p begin="00:00:10.246">I knew that if I wanted to get on I really would have to do something about my reading and writing; with my disability dyslexia</p>
      <p begin="00:00:19.961">it was that sometimes I had to concentrate five times as hard as everybody else and also I had to find different ways of retaining information</p>
      <p begin="00:00:29.204">and I found the best way for me funnily enough was to do like shorthand-type notes or one word or one sentence which allowed me to go back</p>
      <p begin="00:00:40.052">and it would actually then refresh my memory.  I’ve got National Vocational qualifications in this industry, I’ve got some qualifications to teach</p>
      <p begin="00:00:51.904">in this industry which I’m really pleased about, you know, and I also can actually go out there and actually be an NVQ Assessor</p>
      <p begin="00:01:00.997">as well as an NVQ Invigilator so I’ve got quite a lot of qualifications and I think I’ve got more qualifications in the 18 years</p>
      <p begin="00:01:11.006">when I was working in London than I have let’s say in the whole time I was at school.  Now I know it’s an 18 year life experience</p>
      <p begin="00:01:19.446">at work but the qualifications I’ve got I think have really stood me in good stead.</p>
