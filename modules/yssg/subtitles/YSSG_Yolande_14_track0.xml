      <p begin="00:00:00.051">I think really the awakening was at 15 when I realised that our life was not as perfect as I imagined and discovered I had a father who used to</p>
      <p begin="00:00:14.253">beat my mother and he was an alcoholic so that was quite traumatic, we ran away from him and we had to go into hiding</p>
      <p begin="00:00:22.638">for many years so without getting into too much detail it was quite a traumatic shift in terms of what I thought my reality was</p>
      <p begin="00:00:30.228">to what it then became.  What I do take from my upbringing is not just learning what to do but also learning what not to do</p>
      <p begin="00:00:41.130">what doesn’t work and I think that was an important lesson for me...  You know I think if you’ve had a few hard knocks in life</p>
      <p begin="00:00:50.219">it toughens you up and it makes you a stronger person without a doubt you know and you can deal with the tough stuff then.</p>
