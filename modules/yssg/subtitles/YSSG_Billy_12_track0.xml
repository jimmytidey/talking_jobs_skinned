      <p begin="00:00:00.000">I left my family when I was 11 so my mum and dad and brother, I had 3 brothers at the time, I left because my brother supported me</p>
      <p begin="00:00:19.317">to leave the country because they all saw something and Albania at the time wasn’t really the place to be as a young kid so they</p>
      <p begin="00:00:31.914">had the advice to come here and further my education and start my education and start a new life by myself which was very difficult</p>
      <p begin="00:00:43.187">my carer she had only just started doing care work but she was great and you know she has helped me a lot in life</p>
      <p begin="00:00:52.288">she has helped me a lot being independent, being myself, helping me, supporting me to make my own decisions if it’s bad you learn from it</p>
      <p begin="00:01:05.189">and if it’s good how to better that and at the time that really helped me and going back to my family, my family is still living in Albania</p>
      <p begin="00:01:18.087">I went back after 9½, nearly 10, years which was last year for the first time; being by myself here helped me a lot you know it made me</p>
      <p begin="00:01:29.864">a better person than I think I would have been if I had my family around me you know because it made me make decisions by myself</p>
      <p begin="00:01:38.618">it made me sort of discover what I can do by myself or who I can rely on, not rely on but sort of how much I can rely on myself</p>
