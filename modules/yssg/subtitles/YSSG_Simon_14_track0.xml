      <p begin="00:00:00.095">When I was in my teens I was doing my GCSEs, well training to do my GCSEs, and given that I had to go into hospital</p>
      <p begin="00:00:09.994">to get my tendons stretched I missed out on the training, I still got some GCSEs but not the ones I wanted.  I spent a few months in hospital</p>
      <p begin="00:00:20.487">which left me behind on my school work.  I did try and catch up but unfortunately because it was a long period off, it was a few months,</p>
      <p begin="00:00:33.357">because they basically had to cut the tendons in the back of my legs to stretch them, I couldn’t catch up but that’s one thing I regret really</p>
      <p begin="00:00:41.913">is not getting the GCSEs I wanted unfortunately.  In 2007 there was a massive flood in Tewkesbury and I lost my job,</p>
      <p begin="00:00:52.649">I was in retail at the time, because of the time off and because of my house like being done up, we were actually living in a caravan at the time</p>
      <p begin="00:01:01.453">and I went through a time of depression, strangely, but I went through a time of depression because a job for me is identity</p>
      <p begin="00:01:13.659">and to lose a job is losing my identity and yeah I went through many months of depression and my dad at the time he’s always</p>
      <p begin="00:01:29.773">been the yo-yo really and he said to me “right, stop feeling sorry for yourself, get out there and get a job” so yeah I became a security officer.</p>
