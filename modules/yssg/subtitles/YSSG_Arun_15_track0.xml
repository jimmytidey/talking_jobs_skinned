      <p begin="00:00:00.311">I think university is the biggest turning point in my life because you&apos;ve grow up in care, you’ve always had to jump through loops</p>
      <p begin="00:00:10.602">and answer to people, you’ve lost your home because of some trivial reason or you know you’ve got to sort of play by somebody else’s rules</p>
      <p begin="00:00:21.033">whereas at university you’ve got your sort of independence and you follow your own rules and you have your own sense of cause and effect</p>
      <p begin="00:00:28.885">you’re responsible for yourself so if you don’t pay your rent that’s your problem and you’re responsible for it; I’ve never had that problem</p>
      <p begin="00:00:35.216">but you know there’s been things that I know I’m responsible for, you take ownership of what you do and every decision you make</p>
      <p begin="00:00:42.868">will affect you whereas in care it’s like, I don’t know, it’s just not really the same and it’s very empowering being at university</p>
      <p begin="00:00:54.384">and being independent I think that’s the best turning point I’ve got.</p>
