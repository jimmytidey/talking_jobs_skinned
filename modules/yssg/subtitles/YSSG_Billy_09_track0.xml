      <p begin="00:00:00.420">I came here back in 2003 as an asylum seeker and I started in September 2003 at Central Technology College where I could not</p>
      <p begin="00:00:12.937">speak a word of English, I didn’t know anything that was going on around me so at the time it was really difficult because you know you’ve got to</p>
      <p begin="00:00:21.685">make friends, at that time you know you’ve got to fit in with other people as well you can’t just, you’ve got to learn the language</p>
      <p begin="00:00:31.647">you’ve got to know your subjects, I was way behind what my fellow pupils you know were but I kept up with them you know and there were</p>
      <p begin="00:00:46.090">some times when I was ahead of them because I worked really hard and I really dedicated myself to the language, I always wanted to learn English</p>
      <p begin="00:00:55.224">it was really on my mind that I had to.  It felt different but I felt happy that I was in that school because I had a good reception from the teachers,</p>
      <p begin="00:01:08.473">from the students you know but the time goes by and you kind of feel you’re lonely, you know, even though I had great friends and all that</p>
      <p begin="00:01:19.327">but it’s different but I kind of put that idea behind me so I said to myself this is my life now.  Everyone from school, the teachers</p>
      <p begin="00:01:32.252">really helped me I mean when I started I had a teacher she was supporting kids that didn’t have English as their first language</p>
      <p begin="00:01:44.582">who were Asian kids and she helped me a lot I was with her for a few months and she really looked after me once I was settled in</p>
      <p begin="00:01:55.148">and made sure that I was doing OK, making sure that I was getting what I needed and every teacher, you know, they were good to me</p>
      <p begin="00:02:03.101">including everyone really because they were really supportive and they saw something in me that you know so they made me believe</p>
      <p begin="00:02:13.049">more in myself; I did really good at school I got 8 A-Cs which I never thought I would get</p>
