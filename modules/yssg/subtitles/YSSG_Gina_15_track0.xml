      <p begin="00:00:00.411">I think definitely making the decision to stop taking drugs that was the start of it for me, that was where everything started getting better</p>
      <p begin="00:00:08.366">and I could finally see a way out of it; I think when you’re on drugs there’s some big, dark hole you’re in and you don’t really know</p>
      <p begin="00:00:14.172">what you’re doing or what you’re saying or where you’re going or what you want to do I think until you make a decision that enough’s enough and stop it</p>
      <p begin="00:00:20.753">that you can see further and when I did quit I could see further and I could see no this isn’t the life I want, this isn’t what I want for myself</p>
      <p begin="00:00:29.038">I’m capable of more and I want to do more and I’m going to do more and I think then if you get the support from the right places</p>
      <p begin="00:00:36.889">they can help you get to where you want to go and if you’ve got the determination to do it and know what you want to do if you work towards it</p>
      <p begin="00:00:44.294">then you’re going to get there and that was it for me that was my turning point.  When you’re young you think you know everything</p>
      <p begin="00:00:49.493">and you don’t want to listen to anyone you want to do everything your way but really if I sat in front of me when I was at that young age</p>
      <p begin="00:00:57.761">I’d say just listen, just relax and don’t try and please everyone try and please yourself and focus on what you’re doing and in those years</p>
      <p begin="00:01:05.805">time you’re not going to know the people you’re with now or be doing the things you’re doing...</p>
