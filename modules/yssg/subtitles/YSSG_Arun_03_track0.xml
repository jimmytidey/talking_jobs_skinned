      <p begin="00:00:00.091">I didn’t wake up and think you know I want to be an architect; when it got to the stage of figuring out what I wanted to do, so probably 6th Form level</p>
      <p begin="00:00:10.026">because you have to start specialising in certain subjects, I knew that I could draw technically and I like to be creative so those two combined</p>
      <p begin="00:00:19.689">and also I had a bit of a scientific mindset as well and those three combined seemed perfect for the architectural profession.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:28.186">I’ve got a few artist friends and they’re quite happy to live a sort of bread-and-butter lifestyle so, you know, they’re quite poor but they’re happy to be so</p>
      <p begin="00:00:38.994">but I’d kind of like to not return to the lifestyle that I had and even when I’ve got my degree and things like that you don’t necessarily have to be</p>
      <p begin="00:00:47.887">an architect you can be a graphic designer, illustrator, photographer, it kind of allows me to go in any direction. As a sort of student/work</p>
      <p begin="00:00:57.338">like trainee I’m still figuring it all out so that’s probably the best answer I can give</p>
