      <p begin="00:00:00.067">I went to College and did BTEC in Performing Arts and then I went to University in Gloucestershire and did an HND in Performance in the Community</p>
      <p begin="00:00:10.682">so that’s the training in dance and performing arts that I have.  I’ve also done ABC Training which is a course put on by the Local Authority</p>
      <p begin="00:00:21.594">and so I did that and obviously did Safeguarding training, Child Protection, you have to have a CRB check to make sure that, you know, you’re </p>
      <p begin="00:00:32.751">above baord and First Aid training and also Food Hygiene so you can do cooking and things as well so and every couple of years new opportunities,</p>
      <p begin="00:00:42.679">new training opportunities, come up because they like you to keep them, you know, up-to-date in case the legislation changes.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:51.234">I’m slightly dyslexic so obviously when it’s theory-based that can be a bit of a struggle, you know obviously as well when people are reading out</p>
      <p begin="00:01:01.288">things and stuff I’m a bit more reluctant to want to take part in that because obviously that makes me vulnerable and shows up, I guess,</p>
      <p begin="00:01:09.731">one of my flaws so even though you’re training together people have different experiences of the same thing so it’s learning from others</p>
      <p begin="00:01:18.233">really and networking, you get the opportunity to meet new people as well and obviously you can have a laugh...</p>
      <p begin="00:01:25.332">You probably shouldn’t be having a laugh in training but I do sometimes...</p>
