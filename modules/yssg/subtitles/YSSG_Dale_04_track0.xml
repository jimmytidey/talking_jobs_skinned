      <p begin="00:00:00.778">The editing, because I said to myself I can’t... like you see letting agencies or people behind the work, the admin work and things like that</p>
      <p begin="00:00:10.473">I said I can’t do that 8 hours every day Monday to Friday just sitting behind a computer typing and looking at a screen, there is no way</p>
      <p begin="00:00:17.531">I could do that.  Then I realised to get those good pictures you have to edit and the more time you’re sitting behind the computer yourself</p>
      <p begin="00:00:23.713">so it was a kind of a bit of a backfire!  I mean for example for a christening I’d spend about 4 hours obviously during the photo shoot</p>
      <p begin="00:00:33.626">then it will take about 2 days with the whole editing you know but the thing that got me into photography was the people,</p>
      <p begin="00:00:43.123">the activity, the getting out there.</p>
