      <p begin="00:00:01.053">My job is very demanding so it’s long hours you know as and when is needed so sometimes it has an impact on your personal life</p>
      <p begin="00:00:10.155">and your social life where you potentially can’t, you know, be home at 5 o’clock or, you know, attend a certain thing you know</p>
      <p begin="00:00:17.678">I used to work on Saturdays I don’t do that anymore but that has an impact but it’s one of those prices you pay I would imagine.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:26.252">I’ve never suffered from any particular health ailment I would just say you need a lot of energy I think probably for any job that you do</p>
      <p begin="00:00:35.901">so it’s very important to look after yourself and make sure that you have those energy resources I’d say.</p>
