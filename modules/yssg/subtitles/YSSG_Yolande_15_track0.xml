      <p begin="00:00:00.069">There was a very specific moment in my life where I thought gosh this is going the wrong way, this is just ending up</p>
      <p begin="00:00:09.046">I’m going to be just like these people around me and that really scared me; I was 19 at the time and I packed my bags and I left where I was living,</p>
      <p begin="00:00:21.597">I told my mum goodbye and off I went to start afresh.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:27.497">You know I didn’t have very proactive parents, I think they were quite absent parents but life provides you with mentors around every corner</p>
      <p begin="00:00:39.043">and I think we just have to look out for them so it’s either a teacher who believes in you or somebody that you meet</p>
      <p begin="00:00:45.701">that kind of helps you a little step, I don’t think we can achieve anything on our own you know we constantly have</p>
      <p begin="00:00:52.008">so my boss is probably my most influential mentor to date in my life and that’s great.</p>
