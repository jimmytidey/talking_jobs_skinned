      <p begin="00:00:00.125">Family background...  I’m in a family of 7 I only really know 5 of the 7 the other two were adopted; my mother was a drug addict,</p>
      <p begin="00:00:15.209">violent, wasn’t very responsible, you know, and by the Year 2000 we were moved out permanently, we were in and out a lot before then</p>
      <p begin="00:00:29.784">but by 2000 we were moved out and we were separated and put into different places so that’s as far as like with my family that I know</p>
      <p begin="00:00:39.633">and then personally I’ve been in and out of different homes since that year so but yeah that’s pretty much it.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:47.733">There was a couple of a significant families I think so when I was 14 I moved with a family in Barnwood, they were very good, I think they were</p>
      <p begin="00:00:57.260">the kind of family that were very patient with me so you know that taught me to be patient.  The other significant family would be</p>
      <p begin="00:01:05.476">the one that I’ve been living with from 6th Form up to now and you know they’ve just been there every step of the way so yeah.</p>
      <p begin="00:01:16.150">My guardian, my foster mum, well I just call her mum because it’s easier, she’s a teacher, she’s a primary school teacher and has set up a nursery recently</p>
      <p begin="00:01:29.720">and her partner is a social worker.  Well before being in care the fact that we were living in the conditions that we were living in</p>
      <p begin="00:01:39.703">I just didn’t want to be anything like that whatsoever, you can have a good lifestyle, a good way to live and you don’t have to be like the people</p>
      <p begin="00:01:52.358">that we lived with</p>
