      <p begin="00:00:00.278">I wanted to be a dancer, I wanted to be on the West End stage or in music videos that was the ambition...</p>
      <p begin="00:00:11.039">You see the dream was to be on the West End stage or be a movie star and all the rest of it and I’m glad for that because if I didn’t have those</p>
      <p begin="00:00:20.681">big dreams I wouldn’t aspire to be who I am and what I have today and so you know having those dreams have got me onto College</p>
      <p begin="00:00:29.929">which then led onto Uni but I think when I came out of University I was an adult so my outlook in life is different so therefore I thought,</p>
      <p begin="00:00:41.474">you know, logically what am I going to do if that dream doesn’t come true so then I then set up my street dance company</p>
      <p begin="00:00:50.945">and I earn money, I get to do what I want, you know, my chosen career and I get to meet and work with loads of young people</p>
      <p begin="00:01:00.790">in my community so, again, I suppose I’m a winner.</p>
