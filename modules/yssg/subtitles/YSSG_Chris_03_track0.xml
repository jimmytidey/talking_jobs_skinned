      <p begin="00:00:00.054">I have a background in retail and I always was very successful with customer services, I really like talking to people and am very chatty</p>
      <p begin="00:00:12.405">so when I got offered the chance to do front of house it felt quite natural to me because most of my interaction is talking to customers.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:22.545">We get ratings on websites and I most enjoy seeing if I’ve put a lot of effort in you’ll get a review written up and if we get mentioned</p>
      <p begin="00:00:34.812">that is my most favourite thing because it shows all that work you&apos;ve put in that day has been successful and it’s hard work but you get that review</p>
      <p begin="00:00:43.268">and it makes you feel great and that is my favourite thing checking the reviews every night.</p>
