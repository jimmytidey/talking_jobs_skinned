      <p begin="00:00:00.078">At this moment in time I feel very blessed and there’s nothing that I would like to change at this precise moment in time.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:07.569">I’ve got a couple of staff who work for me who are more qualified than me, my youth worker who sort of guided me</p>
      <p begin="00:00:13.478">through youth work now works for me and people say “oh my god that’s mad, your youth worker who guided you...”</p>
      <p begin="00:00:18.971">and I say but there’s nothing, there’s no ego around it, it’s not like oh yeah you work for me now, there’s nothing like that</p>
      <p begin="00:00:25.272">because I learned so much from him and he’s got a Diploma, sorry a Degree, but he’s saying to me “no you don’t need to do a Degree Del”</p>
      <p begin="00:00:33.555">but then I’ve got other people above, not above me, but people in the industry, the council who I liaise with and talk to</p>
      <p begin="00:00:40.078">that are “oh I think you should look at doing a Degree” so when people say “you need this”, “you need that”</p>
      <p begin="00:00:44.374">no I don’t as long as I’ve got what I know and my knowledge and experience, yeah, I’ve got a Diploma that’s good enough for me</p>
      <p begin="00:00:51.977">I don’t need a Degree to be able to say I’m a Youth Worker.</p>
