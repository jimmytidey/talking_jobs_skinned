      <p begin="00:00:00.162">For now I’d like to stay where I am and learn more I think and be able to just take more in just so I’ve got it there.  But obviously I see things</p>
      <p begin="00:00:09.313">that my colleagues do which really appeal to me, especially I think having been sort of a difficult young person I’ve kind of been through it so</p>
      <p begin="00:00:21.144">I think in my service as well they help a lot of people like that and I think where I’ve been through it maybe one day I could do something</p>
      <p begin="00:00:27.788">like that to help someone like me how I was when I was younger and I think I’m in the right place to be doing that one day and that’s what I’d like to do.</p>
