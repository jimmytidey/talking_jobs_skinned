      <p begin="00:00:00.379">Oh that’s quite an easy question, yeah, because my hours are 9 at night until 6 in the morning; I get worn out because of work</p>
      <p begin="00:00:11.688">basically but I do enjoy work but it wears me out physically and mentally.  With cerebral palsy people don’t understand, normal people like yourself</p>
      <p begin="00:00:21.780">it’s, you know, you walk around and it just becomes natural, with my disability which most people don’t understand you’re constantly using your brain</p>
      <p begin="00:00:32.141">I walk from the door to my chair I think what’s going to be in the way?  Is somebody going to come out and break my concentration?</p>
      <p begin="00:00:42.050">One foot in front of the other is a constant, your brain is always working because it’s the balance, it’s the coordination; with my disability</p>
      <p begin="00:00:53.627">it’s the movement of the hands, it’s the legs, I have no sensation in my hands so that’s a challenge, picking up a hot cup of coffee</p>
      <p begin="00:01:04.553">I can’t feel the heat but lifting it up I have to think about that because the water could spill out so yeah everything’s a challenge.</p>
