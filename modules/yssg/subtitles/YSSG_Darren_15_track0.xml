      <p begin="00:00:00.000">Most significant turning point has been having a mental breakdown and realising that no longer could I hide away from fears</p>
      <p begin="00:00:13.382">and insecurities that I’d masked with alcoholism and other forms of addiction in the past and that to get on and live a, I was going to say</p>
      <p begin="00:00:29.983">decent life, but a life rather than being shackled by these former self-healing solutions to go on and move to do a normal life</p>
      <p begin="00:00:41.535">or what I perceived as a normal life is possible because there were some stages where I didn’t think it was possible</p>
      <p begin="00:00:50.279">I didn’t think I should be here any more so...</p>
      <p begin="00:00:53.586">I would say at any stage to take advice and listen to it but don’t let it hold you back from anything you want to do</p>
      <p begin="00:01:05.628">if you want to do something and you have a passion, especially, for doing it try it, if you fail you fail but it won’t be an issue if you fail.</p>
      <p begin="00:01:15.381">I think failure unfortunately is discouraged a great deal and failure is actually the only way people can learn.</p>
