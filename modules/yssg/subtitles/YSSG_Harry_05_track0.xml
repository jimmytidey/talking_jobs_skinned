      <p begin="00:00:00.398">My big friend base was outside the Police because I played football locally and other sports and joined clubs and all the rest of it</p>
      <p begin="00:00:07.545">and I think that gave me a better balance, sort of balanced view, of what was going on because when you’re in a Police environment</p>
      <p begin="00:00:13.830">you become very insular and everyone’s a wrong ‘un and everyone’s up to no good and goodness knows what, I used to go out for</p>
      <p begin="00:00:19.805">the Christmas parties and all the rest of it but very rarely socialised with officers and now having left I keep in touch with 2 or 3 but that is it,</p>
      <p begin="00:00:29.238">you know, it was a job but my friend base for a reason was outside the job to keep my feet on the ground.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:36.484">I keep myself fit and healthy, I have got an old injury from the Army which impacted on me massively but I’ve overcome it and</p>
      <p begin="00:00:46.756">I remember when I joined the Police it took me 4 months to get through the medical because of the injury and stuff; it didn’t affect me</p>
      <p begin="00:00:54.268">in my work life then I think now as I’ve got a little bit older and a little bit chubbier and what have you my knees ache and my hips ache</p>
      <p begin="00:01:03.471">and stuff like that but I’d say that I’m in good health.  Shift work is not good for you you don’t sleep properly and I never have, I still don’t sleep</p>
      <p begin="00:01:12.077">very well now, 3 or 4 hours a night and that’s it and I always have done I think I always will do and that’s because of my Police service...</p>
