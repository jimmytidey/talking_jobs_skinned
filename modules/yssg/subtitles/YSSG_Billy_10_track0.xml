      <p begin="00:00:00.349">I’ve got a Diploma in ICT and when I was studying ICT I failed my first year if you don’t mind me going through, I failed my first year</p>
      <p begin="00:00:07.916">and then I felt really bad about it so I said to myself I didn’t want to do IT at the time I wanted to do business so then I said</p>
      <p begin="00:00:14.966">no I failed I’m going to redo the course again so I went to another college and did it again and then I got double the points that I aimed for</p>
      <p begin="00:00:26.147">and the teachers kind of expected me to get and then so once I’d done that I wanted something a challenge I got linked with</p>
      <p begin="00:00:36.420">Youth Support Team and they saw my passion and where I wanted to go and we got a placement for Gloucestershire County Council</p>
      <p begin="00:00:49.879">in Finance for work experience which took 3 months and that was voluntary work so that’s how it started I did that and then they saw something</p>
      <p begin="00:01:03.276">they saw a potential in me and my manager gave me a sheet which had a seating plan where everybody sat with everybody’s desks</p>
      <p begin="00:01:17.975">and there was mine and mine had XXXX on it and I wrote my name on it I’ll be in that desk...  You know to me learning is very important</p>
