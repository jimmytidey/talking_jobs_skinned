      <p begin="00:00:00.006">My day is quite manic, it’s a very busy environment so you have the phones going the whole time, you have emails that you have to check,</p>
      <p begin="00:00:08.761">you’ve got appointments to go to, you’ve got viewings to do, you’ve got valuations to go to, so it’s about firstly structuring your morning</p>
      <p begin="00:00:17.583">and making sure what are your priorities and what else do you need to achieve within that day and make a lot of space for everything else</p>
      <p begin="00:00:25.978">that’s going to be thrown at you because there’s a lot of unexpectedness.</p>
