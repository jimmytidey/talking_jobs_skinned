      <p begin="00:00:00.443">It’s maybe just me but I have always been a helpful sort of person, I’ll always be helping people; I mean on the way here we passed a car</p>
      <p begin="00:00:07.349">that was sort of on the pavement and a woman was just standing outside and there were loads of drivers just going past but I</p>
      <p begin="00:00:15.199">had to stop and check that everything was alright...</p>
      <p begin="00:00:18.392">See a lot of people think that because I’m a Fire Fighter it’s all about putting out the fires and stuff like that, it’s like the hardest part of the training</p>
      <p begin="00:00:27.645">for me, the hardest part of the job is the training once that’s out the way what I enjoy most from it is just interaction with people</p>
      <p begin="00:00:35.359">if I’m totally honest, not saying I don’t enjoy putting out fires and that I do enjoy it but it’s not like “oh yeah I put out a fire today”</p>
      <p begin="00:00:42.555">or “I cut up a car today” it’s just the interaction with people and knowing that you&apos;ve made a difference, it sounds cliché but that’s what I enjoy the most.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:51.721">When I was like 13 or 14 growing up I could see more people, you know, of my liking in this sort of role because you can see the</p>
      <p begin="00:00:59.299">problems it gives them when they actually say to me “I want to be a Fire Fighter” or they might even say “I want to work for the Ambulance”</p>
      <p begin="00:01:07.338">or I want to be you know even a Police Officer you wouldn’t even say those things back in my day.</p>
