      <p begin="00:00:00.197">I was sat on a forklift truck at my old job and I said to myself I cannot see myself doing this for 45 years of my life, you know and it took</p>
      <p begin="00:00:11.147">me about 2 years to find out what I wanted to do; all my friends were doing music and rapping, I knew that wasn’t for me so obviously</p>
      <p begin="00:00:20.510">I just had to find time to find out what I wanted to do, it could have been anything.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:25.195">The thing that I like the most is seeing people’s reactions when they see my work or even the best thing that I like is when I go to</p>
      <p begin="00:00:38.458">someone’s house and I see my work on their wall, I love that, that’s the best thing and it’s like right, you’ve made someone happy</p>
      <p begin="00:00:47.496">and with your work you’ve developed a mood in that atmosphere, in their environment of their home you know that’s powerful.</p>
