      <p begin="00:00:00.381">It was about a year ago that I was struggling again because I felt I was in a dead-end job and I wasn’t going anywhere</p>
      <p begin="00:00:10.415">I wasn’t climbing the ladder, I couldn’t see any, I don’t know I just couldn’t see any way I could progress where I was.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:23.936">When you do take time away from it and you think about what you need to do, you know, and you’re feeling that low</p>
      <p begin="00:00:32.633">that you need to do something about it it does give you that kick up the bum to just think right that’s enough now I need to</p>
      <p begin="00:00:39.436">sort myself out and support from my mum and my dad to make it happen really so yeah they have helped me but I think</p>
      <p begin="00:00:48.972">it’s nice to have their support but also I needed to do the majority of it, I needed to push it and I think I needed to be</p>
      <p begin="00:01:01.871">the force behind it because they can give me all the support in the world but if I’m not willing to put the graft in</p>
      <p begin="00:01:07.166">it’s not going to go anywhere do you know what I mean?  But they have been brilliant...  She paid me to say that!</p>
