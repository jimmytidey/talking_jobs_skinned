      <p begin="00:00:04.744">you need to be out on the road because that’s where they are, they don’t come in here and hand themselves  in.  Paperwork, the bane of</p>
      <p begin="00:00:10.940">every copper’s life and they’ll be saying it for ever and a day but it was for me...  One thing I didn’t want to get involved in in the Police</p>
      <p begin="00:00:17.768">and did on occasion and it never sat right with me was dealing with child abuse and stuff like that I think you’ve got to have a right mindset</p>
      <p begin="00:00:29.709">for it and you’ve got to be very tolerant; I liked dealing with drug dealers, what you see is what you get with those individuals, with these people</p>
      <p begin="00:00:39.449">that are committing child abuse and stuff like that they’re cunning, conniving and not my cup of tea, I’d rather deal with older villains than that</p>
      <p begin="00:00:49.902">and seeing the damage that they cause to children and stuff it’s heart breaking really and, you know, it’s hard not to take it home with you</p>
      <p begin="00:00:57.448">when you finish your day’s work, you know, and it does prey on your mind and stuff like that and for that reason I didn’t want to get involved</p>
      <p begin="00:01:03.406">in that sort of work having done a couple of cases on the periphery but I didn’t want to get into it big time.</p>
