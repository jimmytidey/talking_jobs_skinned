      <p begin="00:00:07.870">My mum and dad, my mum works for the support team, she really enjoys her job, she loves working with the young people</p>
      <p begin="00:00:16.169">and you know supporting them. My dad works for a construction company, my dad wasn’t so keen on me becoming</p>
      <p begin="00:00:25.965">a dancer or you know going along the performing arts route as he would tell me to get a proper job so he was quite happy</p>
      <p begin="00:00:37.523">when I was in an admin role, you know an office job 9am-5pm whereas my mum would support me whatever I wanted to do</p>
      <p begin="00:00:46.647">and I think also they’ve taught me that to get where you want to get in life you do have to work hard and put your all into it,</p>
