      <p begin="00:00:00.134">When you join up you do basic law input and stuff and it’s very much in the classroom, then, it’s changed a lot now but it was learning</p>
      <p begin="00:00:08.984">the law verbatim, learning your arrest powers verbatim and then you’d go into role plays and go out and try and put these things</p>
      <p begin="00:00:16.161">into practice and you learn basic theft stuff from stealing and basic drugs offences, basic sexual offences and basic motoring offences</p>
      <p begin="00:00:28.123">and stuff like that.  You would spend I think it was 16 weeks at training school which was down near Yeovil and you&apos;d come back and then you had</p>
      <p begin="00:00:37.574">4 weeks with an experienced officer where you were sort of out with experienced officers and they’d show you how to do the job properly</p>
      <p begin="00:00:45.110">and what have you and I went through that process but my aim having joined the police service from a very early stage was that I wanted</p>
      <p begin="00:00:53.674">to be a detective, I wanted to be on the drug squad and do all the Gucci things like Jack Regan and all this stuff that we’d sort of grown up with</p>
      <p begin="00:01:00.921">and that was my aim and fortunately enough for me I had some good jobs when I was in uniform and got myself noticed by the CID</p>
      <p begin="00:01:12.520">and got myself what you call to do a CID attachment first which is where you go onto the CID, it’s like slave labour really,</p>
      <p begin="00:01:21.660">you’re there for 4 or 5 months dealing with all the rubbish jobs that come into the office and they test your mettle to see if you’re good,</p>
      <p begin="00:01:27.710">your investigative skills and all the rest of it and you’re then put forward for your CID training.  Being away 16 weeks I had a young family then,</p>
      <p begin="00:01:39.506">coming home every weekend and having tons of homework to do when I could have spent more time with my family doing family things,</p>
      <p begin="00:01:49.510">my daughters were then 5 and 3 I think at that stage, and I was trying to concentrate on the training because it was important</p>
      <p begin="00:01:58.454">to get through the first 2 years of police service because if you don’t get through the probation period you’re out on your ear so I wanted</p>
      <p begin="00:02:06.359">to put everything into it and focus on that to get through it so it did impact on family life and it did throughout my service after that really</p>
      <p begin="00:02:15.604">because it’s one of those jobs that do...</p>
