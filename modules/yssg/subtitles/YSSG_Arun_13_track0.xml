      <p begin="00:00:00.369">I’m sort of in a transitional period, I’m going on to my Part Two studying architecture so I’m moving houses again, I’m getting</p>
      <p begin="00:00:08.961">my independence back actually because I’ve spent the last year living at my guardians’ house so it’s effectively going back to your parents.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:16.018">I like to dibble-dabble in graphic design so I like to do sort of logos and typefaces and photography; I really want to buy</p>
      <p begin="00:00:24.761">a film camera at the moment because Brighton’s got a dark room as well so I’d like to learn how to develop film photography</p>
      <p begin="00:00:31.765">and maybe give me a better understanding of how to take better photos.  I try to get out and travel when I can whether it’s across</p>
      <p begin="00:00:40.111">the UK or whether it’s a trip abroad or something like that but you know it’s not like a typical holiday where you go and sit on a beach</p>
      <p begin="00:00:49.251">it’s like trying to get involved in whatever’s going on there culturally whatever so but yeah that’s it really that’s what I like to do in my spare time</p>
      <p begin="00:00:59.913">whatever I can when I can</p>
