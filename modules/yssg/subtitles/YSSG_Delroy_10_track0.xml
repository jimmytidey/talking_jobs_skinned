      <p begin="00:00:00.481">Well I started at the age of 22, yeah 22, a year after I lost my dad I went to work for The Prince’s Trust as a volunteer on a 12 week programme</p>
      <p begin="00:00:15.125">just to sort of steer myself away from all my mates and what I was involved in on the streets so I started The Prince’s Trust</p>
      <p begin="00:00:22.154">and I was able to do the 12 week programme and then my youth worker at the time who started to be a bit more involved in my life</p>
      <p begin="00:00:30.920">came to me and said “have you thought about doing the ABC Youth Work Diploma?” Over the space of 6 months</p>
      <p begin="00:00:38.024">I had the opportunity to take over a youth club and my line manager at the time said to me “we’re only giving you this position as manager</p>
      <p begin="00:00:45.208">on the grounds that you pass your ABC Diploma” and I was like “yeah I’m half way through it I’m going to finish it”</p>
      <p begin="00:00:51.680">but got into the job and then sort of put the ABC Diploma to the back burner and then I had a letter 6 months later</p>
      <p begin="00:00:58.077">to say if you don’t complete this in the next 3 months we will have to degrade you back down to a volunteer youth worker</p>
      <p begin="00:01:04.903">so I’m really glad that happened so yeah but again I found it very difficult because of my disability with my dyslexia and I had</p>
      <p begin="00:01:14.676">a lot of support, I had a learning mentor who supported me through the theory side of things but then the actual final part</p>
      <p begin="00:01:24.338">of the course was to do a presentation on a project and I did it on a girls’ football team that I set up called the Star 66 Girls</p>
      <p begin="00:01:31.839">and that was the sort of nail in the coffin where he said the presentation and the format and how I delivered it was one of the</p>
      <p begin="00:01:40.546">best that they’d seen for a long time so I felt good about that but putting things on pen and paper and things like that is</p>
      <p begin="00:01:49.125">literally just going into a place that I really don’t like so I was glad to pass the presentation was probably one of the best</p>
      <p begin="00:01:57.223">times of my life getting that certificate passed me to say now I’m a qualified youth worker but the training and things like that</p>
      <p begin="00:02:04.194">was very, it was a place I didn’t want to be as much as people are very focused on qualifications and Degrees and Masters</p>
      <p begin="00:02:14.820">and Diplomas and stuff I think what I’ve got is life skills and I think that’s things you can’t read from a textbook.</p>
