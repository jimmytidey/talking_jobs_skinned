      <p begin="00:00:00.000">It happens quite a lot...  Not a lot but it happens probably at least on a yearly round, you know there’s always going to be a time</p>
      <p begin="00:00:08.079">when things get hard for example this year, you know you’ve just graduated, the economy is not fantastic and you know you apply for a lot of jobs</p>
      <p begin="00:00:17.172">and it’s so competitive and it’s really hard and there’s times when you think Oh I just can’t do anything, you know I’m not going to get a job</p>
      <p begin="00:00:24.961">I’m not going to succeed and you know when it gets hard you get really low but you’ve just got to endure that stuff, you know it’s the same</p>
      <p begin="00:00:32.954">when you’ve got your exams you think maybe I haven’t got the grades or maybe I’ll never amount to anything but you know you just stick</p>
      <p begin="00:00:42.124">it out, commit to whatever you’re doing and you know whether you do or don’t make the grade or get the job there’s always another way of getting there</p>
      <p begin="00:00:52.157">like going into architecture for example I definitely did not have the grades to sort of get into some of the better universities</p>
      <p begin="00:01:01.328">they were looking for like A, B, B and I got 3 Cs so what I did was I started looking for new courses because at least I know</p>
      <p begin="00:01:10.927">they’re going to put the money in the right places, they’re going to get the best tutors that they can to sort of build that course’s profile</p>
      <p begin="00:01:18.257">and it paid off, you know like you’ve got to find a way around it, there’s always a way around it and just don’t be deterred by bad results</p>
      <p begin="00:01:28.113">you know they’re always going to happen at some stage in your life.</p>
