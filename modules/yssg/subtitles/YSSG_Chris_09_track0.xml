      <p begin="00:00:00.122">I’ve never been to school, I’ve come from an abusive background and was denied the chance as a child to ever get an education or go to school so</p>
      <p begin="00:00:11.747">what little bit of education I have, reading, writing my siblings taught me or I taught myself, I taught myself to read and write at around 6 years old</p>
      <p begin="00:00:24.207">by reading Britannica series of books; the only education I’ve had I went to college 3 years ago to get an NVQ in English and Maths</p>
      <p begin="00:00:34.010">just so I could have that certificate, without that certificate it’s very hard to get employment without GCSEs, without any education</p>
      <p begin="00:00:43.411">it’s very hard to do anything these days so any chance, I look back now and if I’d taken some of the chances I was given to go to college earlier</p>
      <p begin="00:00:52.893">I wish I’d taken them because it would have made things a lot easier now.</p>
