      <p begin="00:00:00.042">What can I see in the future is I would like to go to do a degree in Finance and Accounting and also working at the same time doing an Open University</p>
      <p begin="00:00:14.034">I mean I’m looking in a year or two once I’m stable and sort of settled at work and got my head around it so I would like to do that</p>
      <p begin="00:00:25.264">and I really want to achieve higher and higher in life you know so that’s what I would like, I haven’t got any ideas at the moment</p>
      <p begin="00:00:34.826">where I would like to go but I can see myself being in finance and business in future coming and I would like to finish that degree</p>
      <p begin="00:00:43.618">hopefully one day and yeah so for the time being I’m only focused on what I’ve got on my plate at the moment</p>
