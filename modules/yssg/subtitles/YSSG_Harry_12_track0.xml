      <p begin="00:00:00.001">I had a bit of a strange family background really my father died when I was 9 and I’m from a large family, my father was actually murdered</p>
      <p begin="00:00:10.621">in South Africa when I was 9 years old and we were left with nothing, no money, nothing.  My youngest sister was 9 months,</p>
      <p begin="00:00:20.305">I was the oldest at 9 and I remember hiding from the rent man and all those things and the milkman and free school dinners and</p>
      <p begin="00:00:30.716">hand-me-down clothes and all the rest of it that goes with it, I was left to my own devices really, my mum had 4 other children</p>
      <p begin="00:00:38.126">at that stage to look after and I started getting into a bit of bother, silly stuff – antisocial behaviour, pinching stuff and</p>
      <p begin="00:00:48.008">criminal damage and doing all these silly things that kids do and then my mum got married again when I was about 11 or 12 I think</p>
      <p begin="00:00:56.918">to my stepfather who was a top bloke but he made my life a misery when I was younger because I was such a pain in the backside,</p>
      <p begin="00:01:03.161">rebelled against him coming into the family, I wouldn’t sort of adhere to his rules or anything like that and I’d had a couple of good hidings</p>
      <p begin="00:01:12.760">and the police had turned up at the house and all of those things.  My childhood was happy, it was happy, I had some great friends</p>
      <p begin="00:01:21.073">and had a great childhood, I don’t think my stepfather and I got on, I left at 16 and went and joined the army and now</p>
      <p begin="00:01:27.726">I can’t believe what a horrible git I was at that age really I mean you know I’ve got the utmost respect for my stepfather</p>
      <p begin="00:01:34.403">having taken my mum on with 5 children then, they’ve had another one since, my other sister Alison, taken them on and given</p>
      <p begin="00:01:43.423">my mum a good life really and looked after them, you know, but I was just a pain at that age but you know circumstances I think</p>
      <p begin="00:01:51.157">when I look at it I’m not blaming anyone but you know I had no father figure from the age of 9 onwards really and I didn’t respect</p>
      <p begin="00:01:58.054">my father now until after the event when it was too late I’d sort of left home and stuff and I thought no he’s alright really it was me...</p>
