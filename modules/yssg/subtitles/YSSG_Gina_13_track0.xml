      <p begin="00:00:00.371">Yeah, I have a daughter now, she’s 18 months and she lives with me; I have a boyfriend as well and we live in a nice little house</p>
      <p begin="00:00:10.444">he works, I work, she goes to nursery which she really enjoys.  I’m working which I really enjoy so yeah it’s a really good work-family balance</p>
      <p begin="00:00:21.546">I’m very happy at the moment.  In my spare time I spend time with my daughter, see friends, go out for meals, go to the pictures,</p>
      <p begin="00:00:31.503">I go for walks, like climbing hills, I like being outdoors, I’m quite an outdoors person really which is nice when you do get the time off</p>
      <p begin="00:00:39.994">because if you&apos;re in in an office all week it’s nice at the end of the week to be able to get out as long as the weather’s nice.</p>
