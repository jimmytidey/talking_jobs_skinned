      <p begin="00:00:00.255">Definitely, I’d say I had a bad experience with drugs, I got onto some pretty hard drugs at quite a young age which definitely had an impact</p>
      <p begin="00:00:09.951">on my school life although you know I didn’t take drugs in school it was obviously the people you can get to know outside of school</p>
      <p begin="00:00:18.890">just from going out, just from leaving your door no-one really knows; I got involved with the wrong crowd, started using cocaine and</p>
      <p begin="00:00:27.897">things just sort of spiralled out of control from there really I think and while I was at school especially in my second from last year,</p>
      <p begin="00:00:36.337">Year 10, when you’re getting ready to sit your GCSEs and things it really impacted and actually in my last year at school when I went to sit some of them</p>
      <p begin="00:00:47.458">it got to the point where I couldn’t go into an exam because my mind was just not there, not in it, I think there’s a time in everyone’s life</p>
      <p begin="00:00:56.028">when they don’t feel like they can achieve anything but especially in mine I think because of the drug taking, because I got kicked out</p>
      <p begin="00:01:01.440">of college all those things combined together I just thought &quot;I haven’t got a hope in hell&quot;; I remember sitting sometimes and thinking</p>
      <p begin="00:01:06.883">&quot;God, what are you going to do with your life?  You’ve just totally messed everything up&quot; but I think just being headstrong and being clear</p>
      <p begin="00:01:13.922">in your head that &quot;no, this isn’t me, I can do more I’m going to go and do more&quot;, seeking help from the right places, having a good support network</p>
      <p begin="00:01:22.536">around you and then sitting down and deciding what you’re going to do with your life and actually actioning it and going out and doing it</p>
      <p begin="00:01:29.942">and going through the right procedures, going through training, going through everything you need to do to get there and it’s not</p>
      <p begin="00:01:34.975">a waste of time because you’re learning more as you’re doing it so even if you don’t end up doing what you wanted to do originally I think</p>
      <p begin="00:01:42.048">it’s always going to come in handy, it’s always going to be useful.</p>
