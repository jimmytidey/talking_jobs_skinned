      <p begin="00:00:00.218">I’ve got a daughter who’s quite young so I started off part-time which was nice so I&apos;d sort of come in half the week and have half the week</p>
      <p begin="00:00:09.303">with my daughter while she was quite young which was really good and they’re really supportive of the fact that I had a daughter</p>
      <p begin="00:00:14.284">in regards to coming in and taking time off if I needed to to take my daughter somewhere or being a bit later because I’m taking her to nursery</p>
      <p begin="00:00:22.649">so that’s really good.  And recently I’ve started full-time now so it was nice to be able to sort of start gradually and build up sort of working</p>
      <p begin="00:00:31.253">full-time obviously starting part-time and then being able to sort of learn everything and build up to being full-time and now she’s older</p>
      <p begin="00:00:38.602">she’s at nursery so it’s a good sort of work-life balance I think really.</p>
