      <p begin="00:00:00.459">I had to save £3000 the first time and then someone robbed my house and I wasn’t insured then I had to save another £2000</p>
      <p begin="00:00:15.763">and then I got the camera, I got stuff back like you know back on my feet and then it’s all money, yeah it’s all my money now</p>
      <p begin="00:00:27.090">you know but they were the biggest impacts like you know that £3000 then about a year later my house got robbed that</p>
      <p begin="00:00:34.015">I could have gone any direction, I could have just started robbing houses, you know, robbing shops, whatever like you know</p>
      <p begin="00:00:41.071">to get that money, you know, I want that money back, you know, even so but I stuck at it like you know thankfully there was people</p>
      <p begin="00:00:49.166">that said “do you want to do a job?” you know I said “yeah alright then” then obviously saving up money and then like</p>
      <p begin="00:00:57.315">then doing that, yeah, saving up that sort of money and then putting that work in you’ve got that, you’ve got so much pride</p>
      <p begin="00:01:05.665">in yourself, you’re proud of yourself, I did this, F*** everyone else, who’s saying “oh it’ll be alright” trying to pretend</p>
      <p begin="00:01:14.173">that they’re your friends but then they won’t support you in any other way you do it yourself and you know you get that,</p>
      <p begin="00:01:21.742">I don’t know what’s the word, you can soak in that glory a little bit more like you know you can say I’ve done that</p>
      <p begin="00:01:27.290">like saying a personal, a proud personal achievement when you’ve put the work in and you can see for yourself what you’ve done</p>
      <p begin="00:01:36.785">forget what everyone else sees if you know how hard you’ve put the work in and you can see something out of it it’s a real good feeling.</p>
