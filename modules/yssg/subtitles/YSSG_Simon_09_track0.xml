      <p begin="00:00:00.431">My time at school was difficult because I can only walk a limited amount, when I was younger I could only walk like about a metre or so</p>
      <p begin="00:00:12.984">without getting tired; it was very difficult I was always picked on, I used to be very overweight because I used to spend my time in a wheelchair</p>
      <p begin="00:00:22.743">yeah I used to be picked on, called names so when I was, say, about 14 or 15 I decided to go on a strict diet and start working out and my dad said</p>
      <p begin="00:00:40.634">“start defending yourself” so he taught me how to, I know it’s a bit naughty, but he taught me how to fight and stick up for myself</p>
      <p begin="00:00:48.345">yeah so it was quite difficult.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:52.000">About 7 I would say so I spent about a year at normal school, probably 2 years, at normal school and I was kind of selected out;</p>

      <p begin="00:01:25.101">slipping behind because of my writing and that sort of thing, yeah.  Me and my friend at the time, Dominic, were the only people with</p>
      <p begin="00:01:37.637">a physical disability, walking, people that went to my Special School were outcasts, were trouble makers, so there were people</p>
      <p begin="00:01:51.649">who had problems with authority, people that used to break into places, you know, people that just couldn’t cope with school...</p>
