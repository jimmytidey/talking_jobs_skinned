      <p begin="00:00:00.361">It wasn’t too bad but when I got to about the end of Year 9 my mum and dad split up and I took it really badly</p>
      <p begin="00:00:10.113">so I refused to go to school, I was really depressed and I just would not go to school; the teachers didn’t really understand,</p>
      <p begin="00:00:20.448">they didn’t support me at all and so I did have a long time off school until my mum arranged for me to have a home tutor</p>
      <p begin="00:00:31.285">where I just took 4 GCSEs that I knew I’d pass to get me onto the college course that I wanted to do which was Performing Arts</p>
      <p begin="00:00:40.514">because the only thing that kept me going was the fact that I wanted to be a dancer and that’s the only thing I would do</p>
      <p begin="00:00:47.659">when I was feeling down and that’s the only thing that kept me going because, you know, I was so focused on being a performer</p>
      <p begin="00:00:56.883">I think that’s what got me through it really. People at that age like especially young kids of that age like 14 or 15</p>
      <p begin="00:01:05.517">they don’t know do they? Like they don’t understand that there’s obviously a reason why I was feeling like I was</p>
