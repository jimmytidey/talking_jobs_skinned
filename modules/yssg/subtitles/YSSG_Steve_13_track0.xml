      <p begin="00:00:00.373">I used to be married, I’m divorced, I’ve got 2 daughters one’s 16, one’s 17; unfortunately the 17 year old has got dyslexia but she’s coping very well</p>
      <p begin="00:00:14.286">with it because nowadays they’ve got things in place at school that catch these things earlier which has allowed her to learn the skills to go off to college</p>
      <p begin="00:00:25.125">and do a BTEC in Animal Care.  I live with my parents at the moment simply because I’m in between moving from house to house</p>
      <p begin="00:00:34.022">that’s the reason why so it’s nice sometimes you can go back to your parents.  I like painting, I didn’t say I was good at it, I like painting</p>
      <p begin="00:00:40.972">I love it, it’s something I like because I can get lost in it, I can’t read books so I hide behind a paintbrush, I’m not good I just love it.</p>
