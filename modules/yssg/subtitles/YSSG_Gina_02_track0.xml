      <p begin="00:00:00.484">I work 9:00-5:00, I’ll sort of come in, switch on my computer, check my emails and see what’s come through, what I need to action</p>
      <p begin="00:00:08.434">and then in the afternoon we open up a drop-in because we have a lot of visitors come in so it’s greeting them, taking down their details and things;</p>
      <p begin="00:00:17.671">in the morning you tend to get on with more of your own work like paying invoices and things like that so yeah the afternoon tends to be a bit more chilled.</p>
