      <p begin="00:00:00.205">I’d like to go for promotion, I’ve been a Wholetime Fire Fighter now for nearly 10 years, raising up to the next level would mean a lot to me</p>
      <p begin="00:00:11.332">and I’d also be one of the first black Fire Fighters to be able to do that in the County for the one I work in so yeah it would mean a lot</p>
      <p begin="00:00:21.329">even just for my progress I mean I never like to stay stagnant anyway I always want to do better, it’s like with my DJ-ing</p>
      <p begin="00:00:27.364">you know you start one place and you always want to rise don’t you?  So being a Fire Fighter is the same thing.  I’ve gone for it once before</p>
      <p begin="00:00:34.075">2 years ago, didn’t get through but you can’t let it knock you back you just try again.</p>
