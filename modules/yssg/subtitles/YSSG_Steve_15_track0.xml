      <p begin="00:00:08.628">into the big wide world and that was a good kick up the backside to learn different skills, to, you know, meet with different people,</p>
      <p begin="00:00:18.981">socialise with different people and it made me wake up very, very quickly because if I didn’t do that I don’t think I would have lasted there 3 months, you know.</p>
