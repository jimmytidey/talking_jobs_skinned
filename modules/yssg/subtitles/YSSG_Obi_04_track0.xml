      <p begin="00:00:00.273">Training, for me it was the training, the initial training before you become a full-time Fire Fighter you do a 12 week course</p>
      <p begin="00:00:07.807">and I always say you see when you’re doing something once you know how to do something it’s easy, when something is brand new to you</p>
      <p begin="00:00:17.060">it’s hard that’s when people say “what’s the hardest part of your job?” it’s not putting out fires it was knowing how to put fires out</p>
      <p begin="00:00:22.828">knowing how to rescue people from cars, now I know what I’m doing I can do it in my sleep... Not in a show-off way but</p>
      <p begin="00:00:29.073">you know what I’m trying to say so yeah beforehand the training was the hardest bit because I didn’t know how to do these things</p>
      <p begin="00:00:35.278">so that was the hardest part of the job for me.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:38.523">The actual job itself is the assessments, I hate assessments, put me under assessment and I quiver and I’ll probably fail it</p>
      <p begin="00:00:50.414">but if you don’t tell me it’s an assessment I’ll fly through it so that’s probably what I least like...  There is a, not a lot every day but</p>
      <p begin="00:00:59.504">there is a fair bit of assessment just to make sure you know you’re still able to do the job like you can and stuff like that and I don’t</p>
      <p begin="00:01:05.194">like assessments even when I pass with flying colours I still don’t like it.</p>
