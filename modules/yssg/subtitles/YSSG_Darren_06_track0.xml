      <p begin="00:00:00.427">I’ve identified that the current job I do is no longer suited to me and possibly I followed that career through making easy choices</p>
      <p begin="00:00:15.280">rather than making the right choice and although good at it and very successful at it I think it probably didn’t provide me back with</p>
      <p begin="00:00:26.383">any internal growth or satisfaction and I went through a long, long period of doing things and not ever becoming satisfied I suppose is the word</p>
      <p begin="00:00:41.814">so then unfortunately went to look into other avenues to be satisfied which wasn’t correct so I’ve now identified what I like and still</p>
      <p begin="00:00:55.274">what I’m quite good at and ideally I suppose it’s getting that balance again of doing something you like in life rather than something</p>
      <p begin="00:01:04.364">that is just for financial gain.  I see many kids go to the gym, I think more probably adults or young, especially teenagers, go to the gym</p>
      <p begin="00:01:14.917">for a body beautiful rather than play team sports and integrate in teams; I want to engage children back with what I’d say</p>
      <p begin="00:01:23.831">was a fun development of the human body rather than probably a media-led stylistic view of themselves.</p>
