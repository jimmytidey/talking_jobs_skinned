      <p begin="00:00:00.427">So there’s like 3 parts of being an architect, so the first part is your Part One and you’ve got to study for 3 years so I’ve already done that;</p>
      <p begin="00:00:08.413">the first year never counts it’s just to sort of get into the swing of things, second year is sort of you know you learn to do larger buildings</p>
      <p begin="00:00:16.280">so like schools or offices or something along those lines, the third one is sort of you’re out to make your own work as such.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:26.163">So once you’ve got your degree you get your ARB Part One and usually kids tend to take a year out and that’s where you’re supposed to do</p>
      <p begin="00:00:37.028">professional development so that’s when you work in a practice or you do architectural-related things for a year.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:44.264">It’s not necessary to do it immediately after your degree you can go straight on to Part Two which is what I’m doing now which is two more years</p>
      <p begin="00:00:52.223">of study and then the third part is your exam and you’ve got to be able to know every Building Reg and how the construction industry works</p>
      <p begin="00:01:02.112">essentially and then once you’ve done that you’re fully qualified and you could set up your own studio or you can work for somebody else</p>
      <p begin="00:01:10.066">as a fully qualified architect.  It’s just freedom to do whatever you want as long as you can back it up you can do anything whatsoever</p>
      <p begin="00:01:19.964">it’s a very imaginative course and that’s what I like about working in architecture there’s no wrong answer.</p>
