      <p begin="00:00:00.500">This job, I mean it’s what I want to do, strangely enough as I said when I was working in retail, for me, not for everybody,</p>
      <p begin="00:00:13.888">but for me it was just mundane it wasn’t what I wanted to do and this job has given me, strange but when you do a mundane job</p>
      <p begin="00:00:22.939">you just go “oh I’ve got to get up now” and that sort of thing but with this job it’s giving me a purpose to wake up you know &quot;what’s the day going to bring?&quot;</p>
      <p begin="00:00:34.438">And for me getting up every morning, putting on my uniform, going into work and doing the job I want to do was my turning point</p>
      <p begin="00:00:46.292">I’ve been in the job 3 years, 3 years is a long time but I still enjoy it, there’s people that listen to advice and there’s people that don’t</p>
      <p begin="00:00:56.239">and just take a bit of advice, I’m the kind of person that thinks I’m right, you’re wrong.  My mum gives me the drive and support that I need,</p>
      <p begin="00:01:05.086">my dad said that I would never drive but she said “prove him wrong”.  Training to get my personal flying licence</p>
      <p begin="00:01:17.686">my dad said “he’ll never do that” and my mum said “prove him wrong” so that’s what I do prove people wrong, prove I can do it if I set my mind to it.</p>
