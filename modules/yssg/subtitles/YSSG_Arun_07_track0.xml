      <p begin="00:00:00.127">It’s totally dependent on the job; you’ve got to be very focused on whichever job that you apply for, you can’t get away with sending a generic email</p>
      <p begin="00:00:10.997">saying I’m really hard-working, I’m a really good student and things like that, that’s something that everybody says you’ve got to set yourself out differently</p>
      <p begin="00:00:21.947">from the rest and it doesn’t matter if it’s a cashier job at a supermarket or whether it’s, you know, investment banking or something really complex</p>
      <p begin="00:00:30.548">like being a doctor you’ve got to be able to show some kind of personality that reflects that you have those attributes of being able to work hard</p>
      <p begin="00:00:40.998">and, you know, you’re intelligent and you’ve got the right rapport with people; it’s about projecting yourself as a human being more than what grades you’ve got</p>
