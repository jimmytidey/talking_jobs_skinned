      <p begin="00:00:00.129">A normal working day to me is waking up early in the morning at 7 o’clock, waking up and then looking forward to going to work</p>
      <p begin="00:00:08.657">you know going to work because we have flexibility around the work so I can work around which I do 37 hours a week but I can work</p>
      <p begin="00:00:18.861">my way around that so if I go in at 7 o’clock and finish early and have a longer break... It’s less stress, you know, where you don’t want to deal with it</p>
      <p begin="00:00:31.231">but you’ve got to deal with it but at the end of that when you get to that end of that situation you think well it was good doing that</p>
      <p begin="00:00:38.778">because you’ve overcome that and you’ve shown yourself kind of dealing with it you know in the right way.</p>
