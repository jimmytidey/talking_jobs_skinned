      <p begin="00:00:11.964">check the diary to see whether staff are coming in during the night or during the day and basically watching CCTV, patrolling every hour</p>
      <p begin="00:00:22.461">that’s going out of the building or inside the building sometimes and basically looking around, checking everything’s OK.</p>
