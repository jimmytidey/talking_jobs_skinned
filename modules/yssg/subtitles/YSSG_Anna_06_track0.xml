      <p begin="00:00:00.429">I don’t really want to take on anyone as an employer but I do want to have someone who can work alongside me in the salon,</p>
      <p begin="00:00:07.874">you know to work with me but I’m also hoping to combine the two so I work for admin for the support team and during my time</p>
      <p begin="00:00:21.108">there obviously I’ve realised that there’s a lot of young people out there that don’t get, you know, a lot of support so to combine the two</p>
      <p begin="00:00:32.300">so I could do like recently I’ve done a girls’ group where we’ve worked on personal presentation so we’ve done like skincare,</p>
      <p begin="00:00:40.821">you know the basics of how to look after yourself like to go for an interview or something and it went really well,</p>
      <p begin="00:00:47.927">they loved it, it was something for them to do in the summer holidays and because it’s something that they were interested in</p>
      <p begin="00:00:57.622">they really made an effort and I think it’s nice, it’s something nice but they are learning something as well so I would like to combine</p>
      <p begin="00:01:08.118">the two and do like therapy, like beauty therapy with maybe disadvantaged young people that haven’t, or won’t have,</p>
      <p begin="00:01:16.824">the opportunity to do it, you know they won’t have the chances to do anything like that.</p>
