      <p begin="00:00:00.152">My time, it was difficult, it was difficult, dyslexia at that time, I’m 36 now, so 21 years ago dyslexia wasn’t recognised as much</p>
      <p begin="00:00:19.509">as it is now and as it is now it’s a registered disability so I was very frustrated, I was very angry, I was one of the coolest kids</p>
      <p begin="00:00:30.871">in the school so I thought I had to keep that sort of reputation so I never shared with my friends that I had dyslexia</p>
      <p begin="00:00:38.062">or that I couldn’t read and write, I didn’t know what dyslexia was at the time, so it was that I couldn’t read and write because I wanted</p>
      <p begin="00:00:43.074">to still be the cool boy of the school so when teachers asked me to do certain bits of work I would kick off and I always say now that</p>
      <p begin="00:00:55.624">for me it was always the best form of defence is attack so I sort of attacked the teachers verbally and sometimes physically</p>
      <p begin="00:01:03.667">so my schooling was very up and down, I never had any support from teachers because they didn’t know what dyslexia was</p>
      <p begin="00:01:14.226">as much as they do now so in a nutshell I would say it was very frustrating and difficult. Being the man of the house because my dad was never on the scene</p>
      <p begin="00:01:26.665">I sort of told my mum when I was going to go out and I told my mum when I was going to do homework and I told my mum when I was going to start doing this </p>
      <p begin="00:01:34.501">and doing that and so I think my mum did encourage me but it sort of went in one ear and out the other.</p>
