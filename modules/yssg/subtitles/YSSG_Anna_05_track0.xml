      <p begin="00:00:00.077">For my administration job it doesn’t really affect my life outside of work as, you know, you’re working Monday-Friday</p>
      <p begin="00:00:06.906">and when you leave the office you don’t have to worry about anything else you just go home and do what you want to do</p>
      <p begin="00:00:13.153">but obviously when you’re running your own business it doesn’t stop when you go home, people are constantly ringing, texting,</p>
      <p begin="00:00:21.652">trying to make appointments and you have to think about the next best thing, think about any more training you need to go on</p>
      <p begin="00:00:27.907">it’s just ongoing, it’s constant so it does have a bit of an effect on, you know, your life outside of work but my business is my priority at the moment.</p>
