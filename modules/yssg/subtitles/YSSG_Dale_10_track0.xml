      <p begin="00:00:00.048">I went to do a 2 year National Diploma Course at Gloucester College but before that I had to do a First Diploma because my GCSEs were so poor</p>
      <p begin="00:00:12.697">I had to do a First Diploma in Art and Design for 1 year so 3 years at college...  The hardest thing was I don’t think I, I can’t remember</p>
      <p begin="00:00:28.838">any difficulties like you know I was homeless and you know getting to college because I was moving all over Gloucestershire</p>
      <p begin="00:00:38.925">for accommodation one night here, one night there so I had to get back to Gloucester and then I had my home in a sports bag</p>
      <p begin="00:00:46.741">that was probably the hardest, nothing to do with the course itself you know...</p>
      <p begin="00:00:54.009">I knew that I had to learn this to be who I wanted to be like you know this is all important to my career like you know that I wanted to do</p>
      <p begin="00:01:05.549">so I soaked it all in, you know, but I had some like real bad domestic like home life outside of college which affected it</p>
      <p begin="00:01:15.243">so my concentration was to obviously attend and just to pass so “right your grades are... you can’t do the course any more”</p>
      <p begin="00:01:23.941">because obviously teachers would put pressure on you like that which is good because it kept you going like but</p>
      <p begin="00:01:29.558">yeah I loved everything about the education of photography, you know it’s what I wanted to do</p>
