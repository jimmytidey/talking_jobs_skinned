      <p begin="00:00:00.325">As a child I always wanted to do DJ-ing, the weird thing is I love DJ-ing like that’s all I would ever think about but I never saw it</p>
      <p begin="00:00:10.557">as a full-time job maybe because I was sort of aware that it’s not something that you do until you’re like 50 or 60 years old</p>
      <p begin="00:00:17.540">so it was always something that I wanted to do in my time but job-wise... To be totally honest with you, you know when they ask you</p>
      <p begin="00:00:26.651">when you’re 15 or 16 what do you want to do when you leave school?  The only thing I could say was like “I want to be a solicitor&quot;,</p>
      <p begin="00:00:32.594">&quot;I want to be a lawyer” I was interested in law but I still didn’t know what I really wanted to do so yeah I wanted to be a Fire Fighter</p>
      <p begin="00:00:41.692">when I was 10 but then that idea went away because I didn’t see many black Fire Fighters at the time as well so I thought that was</p>
      <p begin="00:00:48.259">beyond me, obviously now you’re older you sort of realise but at the time I thought it was beyond me so yeah I was really all about the place</p>
      <p begin="00:00:56.301">I mean I remember at about 15 we had work experience and you could choose where you wanted to go and I remember my friend</p>
      <p begin="00:01:06.197">must have chosen to work at a car mechanic, I think something like KwikFit or something like that, one of those car mechanic places</p>
      <p begin="00:01:11.688">so I was like “oh yeah cool, cool give me the number let me sort that one out” because I was just so keen to sort my week out</p>
      <p begin="00:01:17.401">for work experience I remember sorting it out, I went back home and I was like “mum I sorted out work experience for next month”</p>
      <p begin="00:01:23.393">and she was like “oh what did you get?” and I was like “working at the car mechanic place” and she was like “you ain’t doing that”</p>
      <p begin="00:01:28.516">and I couldn’t understand it and I was like “why?”  Like “that’s work experience I’ll be able to see what a work environment’s like”</p>
      <p begin="00:01:35.493">and she was like “no you don’t want to do that do you?” I was like “I don’t want to be a car mechanic but it’s the experience”</p>
      <p begin="00:01:40.258">obviously you know when you’re a kid you don’t really see what your parents are trying to say but at that moment I realised</p>
      <p begin="00:01:46.134">what she did was she cancelled it and got me work experience at a radio station alright, so it was something I really wanted to do</p>
      <p begin="00:01:52.914">so basically my work experience I didn’t waste my time at all because it was something that I was interested in and keen with</p>
      <p begin="00:01:59.352">and I worked at the local radio station and even just being like able to select tracks throughout the day was a big thing to me</p>
      <p begin="00:02:05.546">so it’s one of those things I didn’t appreciate at the time but at that moment I could see what my mum was saying she was like</p>
      <p begin="00:02:11.147">“do something that you like not just get it all sorted” so yeah, so I’d say DJ-ing, I always wanted to do that.</p>
