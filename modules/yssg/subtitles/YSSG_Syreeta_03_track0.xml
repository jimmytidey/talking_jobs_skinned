      <p begin="00:00:00.219">Just generally about their self-esteem, things like that, that’s the best bit of it to be honest.  And obviously if they come out, if they’ve been excluded</p>
      <p begin="00:00:09.873">from school and they’ve passed qualifications and they’ve moved on to college obviously that’s a huge, huge achievement for them</p>
      <p begin="00:00:19.907">and something that I’m proud of being involved with...  Because obviously I’m working in youth inclusion setting they have to come to us</p>
      <p begin="00:00:31.002">because they’ve either been expelled from school or are at risk of exclusion so it’s a different reason why they’re coming, and dancing is</p>
      <p begin="00:00:40.510">they want to come, they want to learn, they want to engage...</p>
      <p begin="00:00:45.600">I firstly met a youth worker when I was teaching dancing and so yeah I got to spend time with them and I enjoyed watching them interact</p>
      <p begin="00:00:56.967">with the young people and I just thought it was something that I would like to get into, youth work.</p>
