      <p begin="00:00:00.049">Yeah I suppose it’s waking up in the morning whether I can do the job but I always get up, always go to work, like this morning I knew I had</p>
      <p begin="00:00:07.699">to, you know, get up by 12 so I had to jump on the cycle machine, work my muscles, you know work my upper body, get my legs like loose</p>
      <p begin="00:00:22.790">so I can walk yeah it’s a normal routine for me, people wouldn’t understand but it’s become so natural to me over the years that I don’t think about it</p>
      <p begin="00:00:32.256">you know an hour’s training is nothing to me because it’s just normal routine.  If I know that I’m going to have to confront somebody</p>
      <p begin="00:00:41.361">that’s able-bodied then I engage my brain and think “right for a few seconds you’re going to try and walk normally”, a normal person won’t understand</p>
      <p begin="00:00:56.058">but somebody with a disability would because they have that moment where they go “think, right, I’m going to work all my muscles and try and walk </p>
      <p begin="00:01:04.310">normally&quot; so what I do is think “right I’m going to go outside now and confront this young person and tell them he should leave the premises or</p>
      <p begin="00:01:16.398">he’s on camera please leave the premises” but with a young person if you’re nice to them they’ll be nice to you back, if you talk down to them</p>
      <p begin="00:01:24.710">you know they’re going to answer you back and start being aggressive so you just talk to them in a general manner like calmly and not</p>
      <p begin="00:01:35.327">being intimidating and they’re quite nice, yeah, not one of them’s come back to me anyway and started calling me names or anything like that.</p>
