      <p begin="00:00:00.290">Yeah, my mum and dad they were great parents they were very supportive, they always sort of pushed me to do well and tried to recognise</p>
      <p begin="00:00:09.766">what you were good at and support you in that; they were also good if you did things wrong they would always tell you off appropriately</p>
      <p begin="00:00:17.163">not sort of let anything slide and I think that’s important when you’re growing up.  They were always there for you and it wasn’t them</p>
      <p begin="00:00:23.939">that was a problem with me it was me, I sort of went out and made a lot of bad decisions which I don’t think they were, I think it</p>
      <p begin="00:00:31.288">disappointed them a lot I think but it’s good now because we all sort of get on again and obviously I left home at a young age because</p>
      <p begin="00:00:39.722">I was quite disruptive in the family, I had no regard for rules, no respect for particularly any other and I think a lot of that was to do with</p>
      <p begin="00:00:47.963">my substance misuse and I’ve got a sister and it wasn’t doing her any good being around it so that’s when I left home...</p>
      <p begin="00:00:58.779">I left home because it was me, it wasn’t my family, I want to stress that, you know, I had a really good family and it was just the best decision</p>
      <p begin="00:01:10.985">and I still think it was a good decision that I did leave home even now, even although I think sometimes it was such a mistake</p>
      <p begin="00:01:17.638">I’ve learnt a lot from living independently and it made me be way more self-sufficient and actually do things for myself and go and get myself training</p>
      <p begin="00:01:26.134">and get myself into a job rather than expecting things off my parents and dossing around at home so eventually I did sort of get back onto the straight and </p>
      <p begin="00:01:35.088">narrow through the help of various programme officers and help, you know, with substance abuse and things just to get your mind back in the right </p>
      <p begin="00:01:43.485">place and then eventually I got back in contact with my family and they helped me through it as well and it’s hard, it’s very hard being young I think</p>
      <p begin="00:01:54.538">and no-one says it’s easy but you’ve just got to keep looking to the future I think and just keep thinking you need to do something</p>
      <p begin="00:02:02.008">because no-one else, it’s down to you, no-one else is going to help you, no-one else is going to make you anything you’ve got to put the</p>
      <p begin="00:02:07.906">hard work in and I think when you realise that and as long as you have got solid people there to guide you you can do it, you can do what you want to do</p>
      <p begin="00:02:15.690">and I was lucky enough to have all those people around to help and put the hard work in and while I was in supported housing</p>
      <p begin="00:02:22.060">still got on and did my apprenticeship and got through it and had the solid ground there to get a job and to do well.</p>
