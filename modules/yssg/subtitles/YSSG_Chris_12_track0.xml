      <p begin="00:00:00.458">I was taken from my parents at the age of 3, I was put into an abusive situation with a foster carer, I have a younger brother who was also</p>
      <p begin="00:00:11.975">in that abusive situation with me so we pretty much teamed up until I was about 16 when I went into a modern care home situation and have been</p>
      <p begin="00:00:22.360">bounced off every foster family you can think of ever since. I ended up in something called Solutions back then, shared housing, all shared</p>
      <p begin="00:00:37.063">and actually ended up living with these people as a guest, almost, for a while, I was with them for 5 years and they’ve pretty much adopted me as a son.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:51.266">Since then I’ve come out of care and I’ve been living on my own. I’ve learnt to be very thankful for every chance I’ve had and my background has been</p>
      <p begin="00:01:09.010">very punishing personally and to be given chances they don’t just get thrown at you and when one does get thrown at you take it</p>
      <p begin="00:01:18.828">and give it your all and I’ve learnt to do that very quickly.</p>
