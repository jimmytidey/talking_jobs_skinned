      <p begin="00:00:00.335">My first 3 years I was a behaved child, my dad was living in my house and he was the disciplinarian, he brought discipline</p>
      <p begin="00:00:10.283">into the house so you know obviously fear you wouldn’t want to cross the line or anything like that so the first 2 or 3 years</p>
      <p begin="00:00:18.177">I was kind of like a good boy but, yeah, the last 2 years I was trouble setting off fire extinguishers and you know running around,</p>
      <p begin="00:00:28.951">skiving school, I did not take school seriously one bit, not one bit, I didn’t take... I even missed exams because I couldn’t be bothered</p>
      <p begin="00:00:39.936">I didn’t have the patience to just sit in a class for 50 minutes let alone like to do a 2 hour exam or spend the whole day inside</p>
      <p begin="00:00:50.347">school because you ain’t got no bills to pay and you ain’t got no responsibilities it was just carelessness</p>
      <p begin="00:00:54.937">like you know just didn’t care, why not?  Because of my clowning around and messing around at school you know I couldn’t get into college</p>
      <p begin="00:01:04.851">I couldn’t get into the course that I wanted to get on...</p>
