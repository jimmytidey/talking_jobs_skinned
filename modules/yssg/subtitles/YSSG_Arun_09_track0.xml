      <p begin="00:00:00.027">When you’re in Year 7 you’re sort of a small fish in a giant pond, everyone’s trying to figure out their place and you know with all the problems I had at home</p>
      <p begin="00:00:10.751">you know I was quite hostile as a kid and kids are generally hostile to each other, you know kids can be cruel and I didn’t take well to that</p>
      <p begin="00:00:20.982">and the other kids didn’t take well to that so I wasn’t very popular with the kids and they weren’t very popular with me but as you get older</p>
      <p begin="00:00:31.280">people become more understanding so it’s easier to make friends I think.  I mean through Year 7 to Year 11 it wasn’t fantastic but as I went into Sixth Form</p>
      <p begin="00:00:44.678">it was like a new slate, I could wipe the slate clean, making friends was actually surprisingly a lot easier, there was no pressure, I think partially because</p>
      <p begin="00:00:55.032">I didn’t say that I was in care or anything like that, you know, they just respected me for who I was rather than what I was like beforehand.</p>
      <p begin="00:01:05.377">I don’t know, I actually don’t know that, I don’t think anyone really encouraged me to stay in school or do certain things or anything like that</p>
      <p begin="00:01:16.258">just went with it, just I know that I didn’t want to have the lifestyle that I had and I knew the best way to do that was to go through school at the time</p>
      <p begin="00:01:28.258">let’s put it that way<br/></p>
