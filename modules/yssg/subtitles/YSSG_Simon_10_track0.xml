      <p begin="00:00:00.130">We had to get an SOE licence, go on a course, a written course, two I think; I did my CCTV course, yeah a general security guard course</p>
      <p begin="00:00:15.062">to get the licences.  The CCTV course was quite interesting because you have to get the general terminology like IC1 male, IC3 male...</p>
      <p begin="00:00:24.656">You basically do role playing like one person is going to act suspiciously on the camera, did you get his clothes, his age, do any other features stick out?</p>
      <p begin="00:00:37.044">I had to do a Health and Safety course, a First Aid course, I enjoyed them all for different reasons, it taught you how to deal with things</p>
      <p begin="00:00:50.428">in different environments.  I enjoyed the learning aspect really, no there wasnâ€™t really any hard part, not that I can think of.</p>
