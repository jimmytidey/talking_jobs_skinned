      <p begin="00:00:00.032">I know for staff we take on we’re looking for trust, trust is a big thing; loyalty, just be willing to go that little bit extra and you know maybe</p>
      <p begin="00:00:15.074">stay that extra 10 minutes at the end of shift when no clock watching, you know people are looking for versatility, you need to be able to do</p>
      <p begin="00:00:24.938">multiple things and but the biggest thing for us is loyalty, we’ve hired staff and they’ve maybe found a job with a couple of extra hours</p>
      <p begin="00:00:37.834">and they’ve handed in their notice that day and not turned up for shift and you know it lets the whole company down and it’s very hard on us other staff</p>
      <p begin="00:00:47.763">so I think loyalty is the biggest thing.</p>
