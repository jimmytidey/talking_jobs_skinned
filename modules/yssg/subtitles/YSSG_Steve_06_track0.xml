      <p begin="00:00:00.023">What I’d like to do next is expand, I think we’re at the stage now of being established for 13 years to sort of expand outside Gloucestershire</p>
      <p begin="00:00:09.474">I mean one of our main goals really is to be the best security company, or man guarding security company, in the Southwest and I think</p>
      <p begin="00:00:17.699">we’ve got some good opportunities to do that because we do work for some corporate companies and it would be nice to sort of break into</p>
      <p begin="00:00:25.144">Bristol, it would be nice to break out let’s say in the Swindon area and actually going down towards the Plymouth area</p>
      <p begin="00:00:31.692">so I think we’ve got our long-term goals in place it’s just making sure we do it at the right time without overstretching ourselves.</p>
