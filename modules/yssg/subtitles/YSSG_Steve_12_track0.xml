      <p begin="00:00:00.458">I come from a family of 6 children, unfortunately when I was 14 my oldest brother was killed in an accident, I used to live in Cumbria,</p>
      <p begin="00:00:12.613">you know a normal sort of family way of being brought up, my mother and father worked hard all their lives and you can appreciate that money wasn’t</p>
      <p begin="00:00:23.460">always there so we couldn’t have everything that we wanted but I would say that my childhood, apart from the school side of things,</p>
      <p begin="00:00:33.624">was happy, it was happy because we went on holiday once a year, my parents did provide for us and you know to be honest with you</p>
      <p begin="00:00:47.957">they were a fantastic mum and dad and they’re still alive today thank goodness, you know.  They really instilled into myself and my sisters</p>
      <p begin="00:00:55.279">to respect people so I really think it’s, you know, going back to my parents and everything you know I couldn’t ask for better role models</p>
      <p begin="00:01:06.082">to be honest with you I really couldn’t.</p>
