      <p begin="00:00:14.742">you know just capture the moment... “Oh you’re that photographer, you’re that photographer, I know you...” and</p>
      <p begin="00:00:21.843">well a popular thing though but it’s just recognition you know which is a good thing because obviously they see me through my work</p>
      <p begin="00:00:28.571">not through anything else, you know, “oh there’s that trouble maker you know he gets drunk every weekend...”</p>
