      <p begin="00:00:12.041">they sit down, do some education, have a break, a bit more education then they have their lunch and then they have alternative time</p>
      <p begin="00:00:23.186">so they obviously get to do the sports, drama, dance, watching a film, reading a magazine, mentoring that kind of thing.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:30.488">On the evenings I teach dancing so it’s totally different, obviously the goals and outcomes are different to my job in the daytime  so I tend</p>
      <p begin="00:00:41.335">to do obviously when I go there I’ve got to be in a different frame of mind, I have to be upbeat so the young people take part </p>
      <p begin="00:00:49.241">because they don’t want a moany teacher...</p>
