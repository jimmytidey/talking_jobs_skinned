      <p begin="00:00:00.487">I have just recently opened my own beauty salon where I work 3 days a week and then I also work 3 days a week doing admin.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:08.848">As a beautician, well a beauty therapist, we obviously deal with a lot of different clients every day doing their treatments but also there’s a lot more involved</p>
      <p begin="00:00:22.830">and it’s my own business so I have to do, you know, all the promotions, marketing, leaflets, appointment bookings, you know, everything that goes along</p>
      <p begin="00:00:36.797">with setting up your own business and also with my admin job I deal with the petty cash and literally just supporting the social workers within their job roles</p>
      <p begin="00:00:54.032">so it&apos;s totally different.</p>
