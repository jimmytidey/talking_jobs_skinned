      <p begin="00:00:00.035">My name’s Harry and my last job was a police officer.  There are numerous facets to it, my last bit of employment in the police I was on</p>
      <p begin="00:00:10.679">a gang unit, if you like, we had some problems with gangs here in Gloucester and stuff which were linked with drugs, we had some shootings</p>
      <p begin="00:00:20.039">and other bits and pieces and a small taskforce was set up to sort of target these individuals, look at the gang culture within the city,</p>
      <p begin="00:00:28.988">how far it extended out and target them, take them out and make the place a safer place so that’s what we did, we were successful with it,</p>
      <p begin="00:00:42.126">it’s still going on now since I’ve left.</p>
