      <p begin="00:00:00.063">Primary School and Junior School was happy dancing about, I had a really good time; Senior School started off OK Years 7 and 8,</p>
      <p begin="00:00:11.253">in Year 9 I had quite a bad time, I was being bullied, I went to an all girls school, and one day I went in and nobody was talking to me</p>
      <p begin="00:00:23.063">and that lasted for about 4 or 5 months.  You know it really damaged my self-esteem and my self-worth, I was isolated where I was quite a happy child</p>
      <p begin="00:00:36.963">and got on with everybody and, you know, was always there and out and about so to staying at home really, quite scared to and put out</p>
      <p begin="00:00:46.715">that I was really scared to go to school so yeah...</p>
      <p begin="00:00:52.142">There was a lady and basically she did mentoring and I used to go to her and she was very encouraging, her name is Dee actually</p>
      <p begin="00:01:07.454">I didn’t learn that until about 5 years ago because obviously you call her Mrs...  I think the mentor that I spoke about earlier is the only one</p>
      <p begin="00:01:15.116">that thought something’s not quite right here but I went through Primary to Senior School with nobody actually picking it up</p>
      <p begin="00:01:25.766">it’s not until I went to College and obviously you’ve got to sit a test and then they said you’re slightly dyslexic which was good, I was happy about that</p>
      <p begin="00:01:35.402">because then I didn’t feel stupid, and like something obviously wasn’t right so...</p>
