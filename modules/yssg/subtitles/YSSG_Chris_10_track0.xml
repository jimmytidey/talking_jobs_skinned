      <p begin="00:00:00.259">There is some basic training you need when working in hospitality, it depends what side of hospitality you’re working in if you’re working in the kitchens</p>
      <p begin="00:00:07.078">there’s a Kitchen Hygiene course which I’ve done; I’ve done a basic First Aid course with St John’s Ambulance and I used to work in retail</p>
      <p begin="00:00:16.735">I had a friend in retail who pushed me very heavily to go and get some qualifications to push me into a further chance of job prospects in the future</p>
      <p begin="00:00:30.908">I thought college would be absolutely crap and I couldn’t be bothered going back to basics and learning basic English and Maths</p>
      <p begin="00:00:39.583">when I thought I could do it all... Actually there was a lot I didn’t know and now I’ve got the piece of paper it’s helped me a lot.  The hardest part</p>
      <p begin="00:00:50.007">was writing out the assessment forms, that was the hardest thing for me and I had to get help from my step sister who is a lot better with English than me.</p>
      <p begin="00:01:01.652">To be able to learn something I hadn’t learned before and to get a certificate at the end for me the certificate is everything.</p>
