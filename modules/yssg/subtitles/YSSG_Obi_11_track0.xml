      <p begin="00:00:00.735">Watch life; what it is to actually be on watch...  I don’t mean it in a negative way but yeah they didn’t really tell you what watch life</p>
      <p begin="00:00:10.647">was like so you sort of had a very vague idea of what it was going to be like once you go into station but not exactly how it would be</p>
      <p begin="00:00:21.457">which was probably part of the surprise to be honest because, you know, all said and done I was very, very excited once I got my station post</p>
      <p begin="00:00:31.241">and I remember like the first 2 days before I started, so 2 days prior, and I remember saying “I start work soon”</p>
      <p begin="00:00:40.840">“I start work soon” because I was going to be on station, I was going to be like a real Fire Fighter and everyone was like</p>
      <p begin="00:00:45.201">“you’re excited to be going to work?” and I was like “yeah” because you know I was starting a new role and then once you started</p>
      <p begin="00:00:51.613">that faded but I do enjoy the job, the job itself, I wouldn’t do anything different</p>
