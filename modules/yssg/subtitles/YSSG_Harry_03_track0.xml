      <p begin="00:00:00.440">It wasn’t something that I wanted to do from a young child as some do, prior to joining the Police I was in the Army, I got to the age of 29,</p>
      <p begin="00:00:10.385">I loved the Army but I was away all the time on operations on this, that and the other and I thought I need some stability because at that stage</p>
      <p begin="00:00:17.821">I was married and had young children; I enjoyed the Police Service, I joined to make a difference, I joined to want to help people, vulnerable people</p>
      <p begin="00:00:29.027">and all the rest of it, I know now it’s an old cliché and I see officers that have gone on in their careers and those attitudes change,</p>
      <p begin="00:00:36.842">mine never did and there’s nothing better than catching a burglar, getting somebody their property back, their family jewellery</p>
      <p begin="00:00:45.348">or whatever it is and seeing the delight on their face and think we’ve done a good job there and made a difference and no matter how small</p>
      <p begin="00:00:52.071">that difference is if you can make a difference I think you’ve done a good job.</p>
