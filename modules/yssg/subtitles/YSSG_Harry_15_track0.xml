      <p begin="00:00:00.361">Part of my Army service I went all over Northern Ireland and places like that and I was in the Falklands for the war and ended up getting</p>
      <p begin="00:00:07.469">injured down there and lost bits of my right leg and stuff; when I done my leg other people got killed in the incident and stuff</p>
      <p begin="00:00:21.328">and I ended up in hospital in Woolwich and I had gangrene in my leg and was really down and fed up with life and what have you</p>
      <p begin="00:00:32.104">I was going to lose my leg and sport was a massive thing to me, I was 21 years old and I thought “What am I going to do with my life?</p>
      <p begin="00:00:40.172">They’re going to kick me out of the army it’s everything this job to me” and I thought “no I am going to get fit again”</p>
      <p begin="00:00:44.062">I’ll never, ever forget this as long as I live, I was all fed up and depressed and the nurses at Woolwich, I’d just come out of traction</p>
      <p begin="00:00:52.060">and I was in a wheelchair and they took me up to Ward 14, I’ll never forget it, Ward 14 which is a burns unit at the hospital</p>
      <p begin="00:00:58.808">and there was a guy in there you might have heard of him, you might not, he was a guy called Simon Weston</p>
      <p begin="00:01:02.326">who was there covered in flamazine and burnt to a crisp and you know I was having a chat with him and stuff and I thought</p>
      <p begin="00:01:09.975">to myself there’s nothing wrong with you... (Me).</p>
